<FACE,9,2>I train by battling as many trainers as I can.

<FACE,9,2>I'm in heavy training with my sights on the summit! Would you
spar with me?

<FACE,9,2>I'm hoping to discover something through my battles.

<FACE,9,2>Number one! #26!

<FACE,9,2>#26, let's go!

<FACE,9,2>It has to be #26!

<FACE,9,2>#26 will do.

<FACE,9,2>#26 will tend to you.

<FACE,9,2>Draw back for now!

<FACE,9,2>#26, it's over!

<FACE,9,2>#26, finish!

<FACE,9,2>It's all over, #26!

<FACE,9,0>Aack! I misplayed that!

<FACE,9,1>Bingo! Exactly as planned!

<FACE,9,1>Yes! That hit the weak spot! Just as I
planned it!

<FACE,9,2>Critical hit? That one couldn't be helped.

<FACE,9,0>Oh! That's a little annoying!

<FACE,9,2>So... We do this now and...

<FACE,9,0>Awww, that's so tedious.

<FACE,9,1>And that's the game! Ha, ha, ha...

<FACE,9,0>Oh... How could this happen...?

<FACE,9,2>There are many kinds of trainers out there,
don't you think?

<FACE,9,2>Some people prefer raising POKÃ©MON to
battling.

<FACE,9,1><NEMURI,4>Hush. Be good, and stay asleep.

<FACE,9,1><DOKU,2>Isn't that gooey feeling horrible?

<FACE,9,1>I did it! I am so great!

<FACE,9,1>Thank you. I didn't learn much from this, though.

<FACE,9,2>Your power? Eh, I'd say it's all right. For what it is...

<FACE,9,0>I'm furious! I can't help myself--losing steams me!

<FACE,9,0>I lost because of that one move. That has to be it.

<FACE,9,0>I've never been beaten this way.

<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh! So close! If only that had worked...

<FACE,9,2>Bye-bye!
