<FACE,54,2>Hah! You want to challenge me? Are you brave or just ignorant?

<FACE,54,2>You didn't falter at the sight of us. You must have guts. Come on!

<FACE,54,2>Brace yourself!

<FACE,54,2>It's #26!

<FACE,54,2>Right! #26!

<FACE,54,2>#26! Go!

<FACE,54,2>Come back here!

<FACE,54,2>Okay! Next!

<FACE,54,2>Next!

<FACE,54,0>No! That can't be!

<FACE,54,1>There! Did you see that?!?

<FACE,54,2>Right! That hit the weak spot.

<FACE,54,0>What's that?!? Critical hit?

<FACE,54,0>Don't get cute!

<FACE,54,1>Wah, ha, ha...

<FACE,54,0>Ah, clever.

<FACE,54,2>Do you like to battle?

<FACE,54,0><WAZA,223,2>Eat this! DYNAMICPUNCH!

<FACE,54,2><KONRAN,2>My #26's got a heavy punch,
doesn't it?

<FACE,54,2><DOKU,2>That should work well.

<FACE,54,2>There. Do you realize how much more powerful I am than you?

<FACE,54,1>That's it! I win! I enjoyed that!

<FACE,54,2>That was like a pillow fight.

<FACE,54,0>Why...!?! All right, then! I'll raise my POKÃ©MON to be even
stronger!

<FACE,54,2>You're strong! Would you please make me your apprentice?

<FACE,54,0>I lost! I... I lost! Me!

<FACE,54,0>Something's wrong! This just isn't right...

<FACE,54,2>What? Well then, I may as well go home and take a nap...
