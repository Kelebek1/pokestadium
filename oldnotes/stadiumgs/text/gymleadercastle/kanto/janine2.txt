<FACE,1,2>Yep, I'm JANINE. You're saying you beat my father?

<FACE,1,2>My POKÃ©MON are masters of poisonous moves.

<FACE,1,2>I know you're tough. This is deadly serious!

<FACE,1,2>#26, go!

<FACE,1,2>There, that's #26!

<FACE,1,2>#26, give it your best shot!

<FACE,1,2>Good, #26!

<FACE,1,2>#26, put it away!

<FACE,1,2>You're no good for this!

<FACE,1,2>#26, come back!

<FACE,1,1>You did well, #26!

<FACE,1,2>All right, that's good enough, #26!

<FACE,1,2>No! Really?!?

<FACE,1,1>That's the way I like it!

<FACE,1,2>Taking that critical hit... You have no luck
at all.

<FACE,1,0>What! That was a critical hit? What do you
mean?!?

<FACE,1,0>Aww, don't take that.

<FACE,1,1>That'll do.

<FACE,1,0>That's not nice.

<FACE,1,1>I avenged our honor!

<FACE,1,0>I give!

<FACE,1,2><WAZA,226,2>BATON PASS!

<FACE,1,1><WAZA,104,2>DOUBLE TEAM, #26!

<FACE,1,2><WAZA,213,4>There, turn on the CHARM!

<FACE,1,1><DOKUDOKU,2>Poisonous moves sap you steadily.

<FACE,1,1>I did it! Not too shabby!

<FACE,1,1>Heh! Sure, winning makes me happy.

<FACE,1,1>There, there. It went just as I expected. I'll battle someone
tougher next time.

<FACE,1,0>Why? How could this happen?

<FACE,1,0>I can understand losing to Father, but losing to you?

<FACE,1,2>Aren't you something. Where did you train?

<FACE,1,2>Whew. We can't end it this way.

<FACE,1,2>Ha, ha, ha! Is that a ninja escape technique?
