<FACE,46,0>Oh? You've come all this way? Fine. I accept your challenge.

<FACE,46,0>I have received reports that your skills are not insignificant.

<FACE,46,0>I'm sorry to say it, but this is the end. I will eliminate you.

<FACE,46,0>#26!

<FACE,46,0>#26!

<FACE,46,0>Then #26 it is!

<FACE,46,0>Next #26!

<FACE,46,0>And #26 for the finale!

<FACE,46,0>A failed gambit.

<FACE,46,0>Merely acceptable, no?

<FACE,46,0>It's not quite there yet.

<FACE,46,0>Good. Well done.

<FACE,46,0>Oh, I see.

<FACE,46,0>Oh, the poor thing.

<FACE,46,0>Ah, there's its weak spot. Quite good,
wouldn't you agree?

<FACE,46,0>Oh, you hit its weak spot. Nicely done.

<FACE,46,0>Hmm...

<FACE,46,0>Oh. My, my...

<FACE,46,0>Hmm?

<FACE,46,0>How disappointing for you.

<FACE,46,0>Rubbed out...

<FACE,46,0>TEAM ROCKET is poised to take over the
world.

<FACE,46,0>We are a tremendously large organization.

<FACE,46,0><NOROI,2>Allow me to show you a horrific technique.

<FACE,46,0><DOKU,2>Ah... My condolences...

<FACE,46,0>What do you think? International-level POKÃ©MON are marvelous,
aren't they?

<FACE,46,0>May I invite you to join TEAM ROCKET for a career in crime?

<FACE,46,0>You may have the qualities to become an EXECUTIVE.

<FACE,46,0>This does not mean that you have dashed our grand designs.

<FACE,46,0>As reported, you are indeed talented.

<FACE,46,0>It pains me to see your talent go to waste!

<FACE,46,0>I must say, I had great confidence before the match.

<FACE,46,0>Is that so? You're quitting?
