<FACE,23,0>So, you have finally reached me. All right. Prepare for battle!

<FACE,23,0>Have you studied up on PSYCHIC-type POKÃ©MON?

<FACE,23,0>I have observed your battle techniques. I'm ready for you!

<FACE,23,0>Start!

<FACE,23,0>Switch to #26!

<FACE,23,0>#26, go!

<FACE,23,0>#26, fight!

<FACE,23,0>Attack, #26!

<FACE,23,0>Come back, #26!

<FACE,23,0>#26, that will do!

<FACE,23,0>That was good!

<FACE,23,0>You earned a reward!

<FACE,23,0>Hmm... Not bad.

<FACE,23,0>Did that surprise you?

<FACE,23,0>We're taking aim at its weak spot. How do you
like that?

<FACE,23,0>I felt that. That connected with a weak
spot.

<FACE,23,0>Oh... This is vexing.

<FACE,23,0>Now what are your options?

<FACE,23,0>Hmm... This can't be helped.

<FACE,23,0>That decided it.

<FACE,23,0>I blew it all!

<FACE,23,0>You lived up to the rumors.

<FACE,23,0>You may be good enough to join the
ELITE FOUR.

<FACE,23,0><WAZA,094,4>Here's an attack on the psyche!

<FACE,23,0><MAHI,2>You really are unlucky.

<FACE,23,0>That was close. I wonder what it is that you lack.

<FACE,23,0>Sorry about that, but I'm shooting for the top myself.

<FACE,23,0>I never thought you could come this far.

<FACE,23,0>I'm impressed. I have no regrets about this. Go on ahead.

<FACE,23,0>Of all the opponents I've faced, you're the best without a doubt.

<FACE,23,0>I've expended all my power. I have no regrets about losing
this way.

<FACE,23,0>This battle will go down in history. I'm sure of it...

<FACE,23,0>You're quitting? After all you've done to get here?
