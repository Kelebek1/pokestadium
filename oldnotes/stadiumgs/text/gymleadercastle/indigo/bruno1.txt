<FACE,53,1>I'm BRUNO. As one of the ELITE FOUR, I will stand up to your
challenge!

<FACE,53,1>You appear to be quite skilled, but this is your last stop!

<FACE,53,1>It would disturb me for you to underestimate my fighting
POKÃ©MON. Get ready!

<FACE,53,1>Hah!

<FACE,53,1>How's that!?!

<FACE,53,1>Here it comes!

<FACE,53,1>#26, make me proud!

<FACE,53,1>It's yours, #26!

<FACE,53,1>Blast it! Come back, #26!

<FACE,53,1>That's good! Come back!

<FACE,53,1>That's good enough!

<FACE,53,1>Good job!

<FACE,53,0>That can't be!

<FACE,53,1>There! #26!

<FACE,53,1>Critical hit! That's how you do it!

<FACE,53,0>Why! Why take that critical hit?

<FACE,53,1>That's not good!

<FACE,53,1>Good, #26!

<FACE,53,0>Arrrgh...

<FACE,53,1>There it is! That has to hurt!

<FACE,53,0>Argh... No!

<FACE,53,0><WAZA,179,1>Come on! Nail it!

<FACE,53,1>We are the most powerful trainers in the
world!

<FACE,53,1>Let me show you what ultimate power is all
about!

<FACE,53,1><KONRAN,2>Right! What an opportunity!

<FACE,53,1>Hoo hah!

<FACE,53,1>Now do you understand?!? That's the real power of the
ELITE FOUR!

<FACE,53,1>You can challenge me all you like, but the results will never
change!

<FACE,53,0>Why!?! This just can't be happening!

<FACE,53,0>The world is huge! I must redo my training!

<FACE,53,1>Your next adversary, KAREN, has a battle style that is entirely
unlike mine. Now what will you do?

<FACE,53,1>A draw!?! Who in the world are you?

<FACE,53,1>You must have realized the extent of our power.
