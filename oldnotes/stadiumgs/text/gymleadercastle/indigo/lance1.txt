<FACE,61,2>I've been waiting for you. Allow me to test your skill.

<FACE,61,2>I am still the CHAMPION. I won't hold anything back.

<FACE,61,2>I thought that you would be able to get this far. Let's get this
started.

<FACE,61,2>I'll lead with #26!

<FACE,61,2>Fine, #26!

<FACE,61,2>#26 for the win!

<FACE,61,2>Okay, #26!

<FACE,61,2>Then #26 will go!

<FACE,61,2>#26, I'm pulling you back!

<FACE,61,2>That's it. Come back!

<FACE,61,2>Good job. Come back here!

<FACE,61,1>Excellent showing!

<FACE,61,0>Ow, bad news!

<FACE,61,1>That's right! That's what I want!

<FACE,61,1>Critical hit! Nice one!

<FACE,61,2>Ow, a critical hit... Not bad...

<FACE,61,0>Not good...

<FACE,61,1>That's clever.

<FACE,61,0>Ugh... Um...

<FACE,61,1>Gotcha!

<FACE,61,0>It's all over!

<FACE,61,2>Balance--that's the key.

<FACE,61,2>Learn everything you can about POKÃ©MON.

<FACE,61,2><WAZA,063,1>HYPER BEAM!

<FACE,61,1><MAHI,2>Yes! We own this match now!

<FACE,61,2>That was close. Want to try again?

<FACE,61,2>I successfully defended my CHAMPIONSHIP.

<FACE,61,2>It's not that you are weak. Don't let it bother you.

<FACE,61,2>You got me. You are magnificent!

<FACE,61,2>This is the emergence of a new CHAMPION.

<FACE,61,2>I never expected another trainer to beat me... I'm surprised.

<FACE,61,2>That was an intense battle.

<FACE,61,2>I never expected you to do that.
