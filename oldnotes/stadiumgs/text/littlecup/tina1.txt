<FACE,52,0>Oh, hello. What kinds of POKéMON do you like?

<FACE,52,0>I would like to evaluate your skill level. But don't worry. This
isn't a test.

<FACE,52,0>We should both work our hardest so there won't be any regrets
afterwards.

<FACE,52,0>Shall we start?

<FACE,52,0>Will #26 do?

<FACE,52,0>Then I'll use #26.

<FACE,52,0>#26 will go.

<FACE,52,0>#26 is good.

<FACE,52,0>I'm going to switch.

<FACE,52,0>Let's switch.

<FACE,52,0>I'm changing POKéMON.

<FACE,52,0>Well then, I'll do it this way.

<FACE,52,0>Oh, my goodness. Your POKéMON are
tremendous!

<FACE,52,0>Don't be crushed!

<FACE,52,0>It hit the weak spot. Think about what you
should do next.

<FACE,52,0>Hmm... Aim for the weak spot? Not too bad.

<FACE,52,0>Was that planned?

<FACE,52,0>Now, think about it.

<FACE,52,0>That's the way.

<FACE,52,0>Oh... How did it get this way?

<FACE,52,0>Oh...

<FACE,52,0><WAZA,98,2>Personally, I like this move very much.

<FACE,52,0>I hope you learn all kinds of things through
your battles.

<FACE,52,0>There are teachers who have many POKéMON.

<FACE,52,0>Do you name your POKéMON?

<FACE,52,0>Close, but no cookie. Try harder next time, dear.

<FACE,52,0>I battled as hard as I could, too.

<FACE,52,0>I hope the experience you've gained here will help you in your
next battle.

<FACE,52,0>You're a genius. There isn't anything else that I could teach you.

<FACE,52,0>Well done, dear. Keep up the good work.

<FACE,52,0>We should all be friends after battles.

<FACE,52,0>Hmm... Just a little bit more, I think.

<FACE,52,0>What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?
