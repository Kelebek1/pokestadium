<FACE,25,2>I see all sorts of POKéMON in the grass on the way home from my
tutor's.

<FACE,25,2>Oh, you have some good POKéMON with you. Let's battle.

<FACE,25,2>I was just looking for an opponent.

<FACE,25,2>Here goes!

<FACE,25,2>It has to be #26!

<FACE,25,2>I learned that I should go with #26.

<FACE,25,2>#26 fits the formula!

<FACE,25,2>My teacher tells me #26!

<FACE,25,2>I'd better switch out.

<FACE,25,2>Gotta take this one out!

<FACE,25,2>In this situation...

<FACE,25,2>I'm pulling it back.

<FACE,25,0>Whaaat! That's ridiculous!

<FACE,25,1>Oh, yeah! Just like they taught me!

<FACE,25,1>Hitting the weak point? That was just lucky.

<FACE,25,0>Why! Why did it hit the weak spot?

<FACE,25,0>What are you supposed to do when this
happens?

<FACE,25,1>That certainly worked.

<FACE,25,0>Oh, there's nothing I can do.

<FACE,25,1>This is great! Battles are so much fun!

<FACE,25,0>I blew it!

<FACE,25,1><WAZA,237,2>This move is pretty neat, huh?

<FACE,25,1>Are any of your friends good?

<FACE,25,1>You should come over to my house sometime.

<FACE,25,1>Once you've battled, you become friends.
Isn't that so?

<FACE,25,1>Thank you, thank you!

<FACE,25,1>Wow... That's perplexing. I won!

<FACE,25,1>Well, I might not be so bad after all.

<FACE,25,0>I'll get my tutor to teach me some more about this.

<FACE,25,0>Hmm... There must be something wrong with my combinations.

<FACE,25,0>I'm going to be more diligent with my studies.

<FACE,25,2>And I was sure I had you beat...

<FACE,25,2>Well, I know how you feel.
