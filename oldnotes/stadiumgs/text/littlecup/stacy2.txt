<FACE,42,2>Battle? Okay, but just for a little while.

<FACE,42,2>A battle? Certainly.

<FACE,42,2>Let's keep our battle clean and refreshing.

<FACE,42,2>Ready?

<FACE,42,2>#26, please do it!

<FACE,42,2>Get out there, #26!

<FACE,42,1>We can do it, #26!

<FACE,42,1>#26! Here's your chance!

<FACE,42,2>Come back, #26!

<FACE,42,2>Switch out, #26!

<FACE,42,1>That's good, #26. Come back!

<FACE,42,1>That's wonderful, #26! Come back!

<FACE,42,0>Aiyeeee! That's not fair!

<FACE,42,1>Yippee, yippee, yippee!

<FACE,42,1>Hit the weak spot! I'm so happy!

<FACE,42,0>Critical hit? Are you all right, #26?!?

<FACE,42,0>No! That was nasty!

<FACE,42,2>Look, look!

<FACE,42,0>Don't give up, #26!

<FACE,42,1>Outstanding! Outstanding!

<FACE,42,0>Nooooo!

<FACE,42,2>Walking is excellent for your health.

<FACE,42,2>Do you take your POKÃ©MON outside?

<FACE,42,2>A while ago, a terrible downpour drenched us.

<FACE,42,2>It's so relaxing to go somewhere quiet.

<FACE,42,1>Hee, hee... Sorry.

<FACE,42,1>Ahhh... That was so refreshing.

<FACE,42,1>I guess this demonstrates our skill levels.

<FACE,42,0>I feel like I blew it...

<FACE,42,0>Ow, ow, ow...

<FACE,42,2>I couldn't avoid that... Let's do this again.

<FACE,42,2>These things happen.

<FACE,42,2>Oh, well. Whatever.
