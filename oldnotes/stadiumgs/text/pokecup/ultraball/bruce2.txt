<FACE,26,1>Summer means the beach, and POKÃ©MON means battle! Let's do it!

<FACE,26,1>When I watch the sea, my troubles get washed away. A battle?
Okay!

<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?

<FACE,26,1>Tweet! Start!

<FACE,26,1>#26, dash!

<FACE,26,0>#26, let's do it!

<FACE,26,0>How about #26?

<FACE,26,0>#26 can come out!

<FACE,26,1>Maybe I'll change!

<FACE,26,1>Maybe I won't use this one.

<FACE,26,1>I'll change it!

<FACE,26,1>I'll pull it from battle.

<FACE,26,0>Gwaaah! It's rocking!

<FACE,26,1>Ker-splash!

<FACE,26,1>Weak spot? Swamped ya!

<FACE,26,0>Got the weak spot? Groovy!

<FACE,26,1>I'm feelin' it!

<FACE,26,0>Say, hey. That'll do.

<FACE,26,1>Glub...

<FACE,26,0>Yes... Makes me happy...

<FACE,26,1>It's over?

<FACE,26,1><WAZA,240,4>Let it rain!

<FACE,26,0><WAZA,57,2>If you're in the sea, you have to SURF!

<FACE,26,0>The waves at night are so romantic!

<FACE,26,0>I'd love to go to a tropical beach!

<FACE,26,0>I'm blissfully exhausted, like after a good swim.

<FACE,26,0>I was just goofin' around, but I won anyway. I guess you're
just weak.

<FACE,26,1>You're not even good to practice on. I'll go challenge one of
these other trainers.

<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.

<FACE,26,1>I was just goofin' around and ended up losing.

<FACE,26,1>Okay! I'll be training in the tropical seas! Then again, I don't
have the travel budget!

<FACE,26,1>Neither of us were serious enough.

<FACE,26,1>You're going? Bye-bye.
