<FACE,5,0>To be able to dedicate myself to training--should I be grateful
for that?

<FACE,5,0>The struggle to achieve inner peace is another battle.

<FACE,5,0>One must not try to flee from misery.

<FACE,5,0>#26!

<FACE,5,0>How about #26?

<FACE,5,0>I will go with #26!

<FACE,5,0>I share your pain, but this, too, is a trial!
#26!

<FACE,5,0>The finish is important! #26!

<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.

<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.

<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.

<FACE,5,0>Thank you for this opportunity.

<FACE,5,0>I will face you as often as you wish.

<FACE,5,0>That was an honorable battle.

<FACE,5,0>I will return.

<FACE,5,0>That was a good experience for me.

<FACE,5,0>I will try never to forget what happened today.

<FACE,5,0>Ah... A matter of some urgency has arisen?
