<FACE,50,2>...mutter...POKÃ©MON and...entropy... Huh? Don't disturb me!

<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test
my hypothesis?

<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?

<FACE,50,2>I don't want to see any rough stuff.

<FACE,50,2>Don't do anything mean to #26.

<FACE,50,2>Be nice. I really adore #26.

<FACE,50,2>I'm very protective of my #26.

<FACE,50,2>It's my #26.

<FACE,50,2>Retrieval and recovery.

<FACE,50,2>Wait a second.

<FACE,50,2>I have to change them...

<FACE,50,2>That's it for this baby.

<FACE,50,0>Eeyaah! #26!

<FACE,50,1>Yes. My hypothesis has been proven
correct.

<FACE,50,1>That hit its weak spot. Wasn't that
effective?

<FACE,50,0>Aiming for the weak spot... Isn't that a
penalty?

<FACE,50,2>That event was within the realm of
possibility...

<FACE,50,1>See? I knew that would work.

<FACE,50,0>Arrrgh...

<FACE,50,1>Eureka!

<FACE,50,0>Oh... Oh... My consciousness is fading...

<FACE,50,2><WAZA,161,4>TRI ATTACK...

<FACE,50,0>Everyone's so rough.

<FACE,50,2><WAZA,137,2>Let me experiment with an arresting GLARE.

<FACE,50,2><MAHI,4>You probably think I am an unpleasant
person.

<FACE,50,2>My logic is perfect! I don't like to battle, but I absolutely will
not lose!

<FACE,50,2>You can't win because you rely solely on instinct.

<FACE,50,2>I think that you need to study a whole lot more.

<FACE,50,0>Eeeek! How did my logic fail me?

<FACE,50,2>My logic wasn't faulty! There must still be a missing element.

<FACE,50,2>Yeah, sure. Go on doing things in your savage way.

<FACE,50,2>What happens in this case? Referee?

<FACE,50,2>Whew, am I relieved.
