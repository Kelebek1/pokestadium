<FACE,57,2>You're weird. I look pretty tough, don't I?

<FACE,57,2>Are you sure you want to battle? I'm number one at my school.

<FACE,57,2>There are no more opponents in my neighborhood.

<FACE,57,2>Ready?

<FACE,57,2>It's #26!

<FACE,57,2>Ha, ha... Here's #26!

<FACE,57,2>#26 is the one!

<FACE,57,2>#26, here and now!

<FACE,57,2>Get back, #26!

<FACE,57,2>#26, get back here!

<FACE,57,1>Way to go, #26!

<FACE,57,2>That's good! Come back!

<FACE,57,0>Aaack! No way!

<FACE,57,1>Yeah! That's good!

<FACE,57,1>Pow! Socked the weak spot! Good going,
#26!

<FACE,57,0>Oh! You goof! Don't get hit there!

<FACE,57,2>Ohh... That's not good...

<FACE,57,1>Yeah! Exactly as planned!

<FACE,57,0>Shucks!

<FACE,57,1>I did it! I won!

<FACE,57,0>No way!

<FACE,57,1><WAZA,73,4>Try firing some LEECH SEEDs!

<FACE,57,1><WAZA,119,4>I'm going to MIMIC you!

<FACE,57,1><WAZA,231,4>#26! IRON TAIL!

<FACE,57,1><WAZA,144,1>I'll show you a really neat move.

<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha--yeah! I sure am tough, ain't I?

<FACE,57,1>Yeah. You're not too bad yourself.

<FACE,57,2>What? Is that all? I want to battle someone tougher.

<FACE,57,0>Rats! I'm going to catch some more POKÃ©MON.

<FACE,57,0>Huh? I lost? You're kidding, right?

<FACE,57,0>Beating me doesn't make you great!

<FACE,57,2>That's strange. A draw?

<FACE,57,2>Huh, you're surrendering? That stinks!
