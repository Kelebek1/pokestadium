<FACE,24,1>Working on my juggling and polishing my battle skills--they're
similar in a way.

<FACE,24,1>Do you know the FIREBREATHER? We're kindred spirits.

<FACE,24,1>These balls contain VOLTORB. Juggling them is such a rush.

<FACE,24,1>Let's start, shall we?

<FACE,24,1>#26 shall do.

<FACE,24,1>Perhaps #26.

<FACE,24,1>#26, go!

<FACE,24,1>#26 shall put this to rest.

<FACE,24,1>I'll switch out.

<FACE,24,1>Another one will take its place.

<FACE,24,1>This one's done.

<FACE,24,1>...And now...

<FACE,24,0>Aaaah... How could this happen?

<FACE,24,1>That's right.

<FACE,24,0>Ooh, the weak spot. That worked perfectly.

<FACE,24,1>Argh... What? A critical hit? How did that
happen?

<FACE,24,1>Feeling stressed?

<FACE,24,0>Oh, devious.

<FACE,24,1>My, my, my...

<FACE,24,1>I'd say my mood is buoyant!

<FACE,24,0>I was sunk! Rats!

<FACE,24,1>My act is something that I will refine
throughout my life.

<FACE,24,1>You meet all sorts of people when you travel.

<FACE,24,1>I've tasted gourmet food from all over the
world.

<FACE,24,1>I can get by without any money.

<FACE,24,1>I wonder which country I should visit next?

<FACE,24,1>Were you taking that battle seriously? You must have
underestimated me.

<FACE,24,1>I'm pleased with how that turned out. I hope to build on my
success.

<FACE,24,0>I can't go home like this...

<FACE,24,0>If that's the way you want it, I'll SELFDESTRUCT with my
VOLTORB!

<FACE,24,0>I should never have signed up for a tournament like this!

<FACE,24,0>A draw is no good! Let's do it again!

<FACE,24,1>Oh... I understand...
