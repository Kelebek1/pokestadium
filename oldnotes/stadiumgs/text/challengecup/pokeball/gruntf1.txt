<FACE,47,2>Sorry, kid, but I'm going to use you for practice.

<FACE,47,2>What's with you? Doesn't TEAM ROCKET terrify you?

<FACE,47,2>Are you ready to lose?

<FACE,47,2>Try this for a start!

<FACE,47,2>It's you!

<FACE,47,2>I'm depending on you!

<FACE,47,2>Rub it out!

<FACE,47,2>Put it out of its misery!

<FACE,47,2>You're no good for this!

<FACE,47,2>Switch out!

<FACE,47,2>That's enough, you!

<FACE,47,1>Yes! Good job!

<FACE,47,0>Kyaaah! You idiot!

<FACE,47,1>Excellent, #26!

<FACE,47,1>Got its weak spot! Good one, #26!

<FACE,47,0>You aimed for the weak spot! You battle
dirty!

<FACE,47,0>Ack! That was so foul!

<FACE,47,1>Good going, #26!

<FACE,47,2>Do you have personality problems?

<FACE,47,1>Ha, ha... Sorry, kid.

<FACE,47,0>You're joking!

<FACE,47,1><HIRUMI,2>Ha, ha... Your POKÃ©MON chickened out.

<FACE,47,2>You're not bad.

<FACE,47,2>I'm taking this seriously!

<FACE,47,2>Just you wait...

<FACE,47,1>Tsk, tsk, tsk... You could have battled harder...

<FACE,47,1>We don't need weaklings like you in TEAM ROCKET.

<FACE,47,1>I'm finished with you.

<FACE,47,0>No way! Bad news!

<FACE,47,2>You're tough. Come join TEAM ROCKET.

<FACE,47,2>Hmm... So there are kids like you...

<FACE,47,2>What's this all about?

<FACE,47,1>Ha, ha, ha... Run, little baby, run.
