<FACE,46,0>My, my... An energetic child has come along.

<FACE,46,0>You apparently have no knowledge of my fearsomeness.

<FACE,46,0>What would you like to do? Turning back is a viable option.

<FACE,46,0>#26!

<FACE,46,0>#26!

<FACE,46,0>Then #26 it is!

<FACE,46,0>Next #26!

<FACE,46,0>And #26 for the finale!

<FACE,46,0>A failed gambit.

<FACE,46,0>Merely acceptable, no?

<FACE,46,0>It's not quite there yet.

<FACE,46,0>Good. Well done.

<FACE,46,0>Oh, I see.

<FACE,46,0>Oh, the poor thing.

<FACE,46,0>Ah, there's its weak spot. Quite good,
wouldn't you agree?

<FACE,46,0>Oh, you hit its weak spot. Nicely done.

<FACE,46,0>Hmm...

<FACE,46,0>Oh. My, my...

<FACE,46,0>Hmm?

<FACE,46,0>How disappointing for you.

<FACE,46,0>Urrrrrmmm...

<FACE,46,0>TEAM ROCKET fails to terrify you?

<FACE,46,0>POKÃ©MON are cute?...I see.

<FACE,46,0>I ask you to not meddle in our affairs.

<FACE,46,0>You made me rather irritated.

<FACE,46,0>Learn not to resist us.

<FACE,46,0>Yes, correct. Keeping quiet is the best for your sake.

<FACE,46,0>I hope you learned something about the terrifying TEAM ROCKET.

<FACE,46,0>This is meaningless to us.

<FACE,46,0>Well, I wish you all the best of much-needed luck.

<FACE,46,0>Ah, you are indeed strong, but... I wonder...

<FACE,46,0>It resulted in a draw. What shall we do?

<FACE,46,0>Ah... Very good. A wise philosophy.
