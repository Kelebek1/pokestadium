<FACE,12,2>We men of the sea are proud of our muscles! I'm also proud of my
POKéMON!

<FACE,12,2>When we're out at sea, POKéMON battles are our favorite
entertainment. Come on!

<FACE,12,2>I often battle passengers from other countries. I do all the
winning, though.

<FACE,12,2>Okay, time to set sail!

<FACE,12,2>#26, out you go!

<FACE,12,2>#26, ahoy!

<FACE,12,2>#26, let's go!

<FACE,12,2>Ahoy there, #26!

<FACE,12,2>Salvage time!

<FACE,12,2>Withdraw, #26!

<FACE,12,2>You're not right for this!

<FACE,12,2>Switch with the next in line!

<FACE,12,0>Whoooah! That was an eyeopener!

<FACE,12,1>Utterly perfect!

<FACE,12,1>Oh, aye! Lucked out! Critical hit!

<FACE,12,0>A critical hit? These things happen.

<FACE,12,0>Cruel...

<FACE,12,1>Aye!

<FACE,12,0>That was cowardly!

<FACE,12,1>And boom! Down it goes!

<FACE,12,0>Is this for real?

<FACE,12,2>There are POKéMON all over the world.

<FACE,12,2>Foreign POKéMON are pretty good, too.

<FACE,12,2>A lot of our passengers board with POKéMON
in tow.

<FACE,12,2><KOHRI,4>It's not going to move while it's frozen.

<FACE,12,1>Wah, ha, ha! I say, you didn't have much of an impact.

<FACE,12,1>We won't be departing anytime soon. I'll take you on anytime!

<FACE,12,2>You can hear strange cries at night while on a cruise. Want to
hear them?

<FACE,12,0>I blew it! I'll have to refine my skills by battling my shipmates.

<FACE,12,2>I've got to find tougher POKéMON in foreign countries.

<FACE,12,0>I feel like I was battered by vicious waves...

<FACE,12,2>Ohhh... You're not half bad.

<FACE,12,2>What's wrong? Feeling seasick?
