<FACE,33,1>A battle? That sounds rather frightening.

<FACE,33,1>Aren't my POKéMON attractive? Would you care to see them
perform?

<FACE,33,1>I can't beat my mother or the senior girls in our troupe.

<FACE,33,1>May I begin?

<FACE,33,1>Go on. Get out there.

<FACE,33,1>#26, you're my choice.

<FACE,33,1>#26, I'm depending on you.

<FACE,33,1>Your opponent is close to falling.

<FACE,33,1>No, I'm giving you the hook.

<FACE,33,1>Wait. Please wait.

<FACE,33,1>May I have a moment?

<FACE,33,1>I beg your pardon.

<FACE,33,2>Aiyee! You're a tough audience!

<FACE,33,1>I'm elated!

<FACE,33,1>My, a critical hit. Please forgive me.

<FACE,33,0>Critical hit? No! How dare you!

<FACE,33,2>That was so unpleasant.

<FACE,33,1>This could be my big break!

<FACE,33,0>You have to endure this!

<FACE,33,1>Oh! I'm so happy!

<FACE,33,2>That was a terrible performance!

<FACE,33,1>Do you know of Kyoto?

<FACE,33,1>We all love POKéMON.

<FACE,33,1>POKéMON really are adorable, aren't they?

<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKéMON every day.

<FACE,33,1>Wouldn't you agree that I am quite good?

<FACE,33,1>Don't you think you should be a little more diligent and
determined?

<FACE,33,1>I can finally beat someone. I'm delighted!

<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.

<FACE,33,0>I don't like inflexible people like you! I don't want to know you!

<FACE,33,1>Please book us for a performance... How old did you say you were?

<FACE,33,1>Oh, a draw? I've never had one before.

<FACE,33,1>What's wrong? You're leaving?
