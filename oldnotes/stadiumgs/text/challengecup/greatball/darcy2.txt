<FACE,2,2>I'm going to challenge your POKéMON. It's obvious you're proud
of them.

<FACE,2,2>You don't think I'm up to this, do you? You're going to regret
that.

<FACE,2,2>I'm going to finish this quickly, then go for a swim!

<FACE,2,2>How's this to start?

<FACE,2,2>Maybe #26?

<FACE,2,2>#26 might be it.

<FACE,2,2>I think I'll go with #26.

<FACE,2,2>#26 has to be it.

<FACE,2,2>I'm switching out!

<FACE,2,2>Something else!

<FACE,2,2>That one's done!

<FACE,2,2>I'm pulling this one back!

<FACE,2,0>What? What was that all about?

<FACE,2,1>Oh, that was so refreshing!

<FACE,2,1>A direct hit on the weak spot. Ahhh... That
felt wonderful.

<FACE,2,0>Oh, no. Wait! I don't like you hitting the weak
spot.

<FACE,2,0>What? What is that?

<FACE,2,2>That'll do.

<FACE,2,0>Is that how you do things?

<FACE,2,1>That's fantastic!

<FACE,2,0>Waaah! You meanie!

<FACE,2,2><MEROMERO,4>Ha, ha, ha... Stay that way for a while.

<FACE,2,2>There are many POKéMON in the sea.

<FACE,2,2>I want to see the seas of foreign countries.

<FACE,2,2>A sandy beach at night is wonderful.

<FACE,2,1>See? Aren't my POKéMON tough?

<FACE,2,1>It doesn't matter how you battle--a win is a win.

<FACE,2,1>Well, I'm going for a swim! Thanks for playing!

<FACE,2,0>It doesn't matter. No big deal. I still love these babies.

<FACE,2,2>You're really wild. I'm surprised!

<FACE,2,2>If I had known this would happen, I would have gone for a swim
instead.

<FACE,2,2>This turned out strangely.

<FACE,2,2>I see. So this is the end?
