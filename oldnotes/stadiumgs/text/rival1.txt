<FACE,51,1>Yo! You finally got here. Now we'll decide things once and for all!

<FACE,51,1>You just get on my nerves! I'll whip you right now!

<FACE,51,1>There's room for only one CHAMP! I'll make you understand that!

<FACE,51,1>Prepare to lose!

<FACE,51,1>#26!

<FACE,51,1>#26! Smash it!

<FACE,51,1>Do it, #26!

<FACE,51,1>#26, finish it!

<FACE,51,1>Pull back, #26!

<FACE,51,1>Switch, #26!

<FACE,51,1>Good! Switch, #26!

<FACE,51,1>Next!

<FACE,51,0>Ugh! That's impossible!

<FACE,51,2>Hey! You're looking pale!

<FACE,51,2>Drill that home! It can do that, too!

<FACE,51,0>Hmph! So you got a critical hit. Don't start
celebrating just yet!

<FACE,51,0>What do you mean by that?

<FACE,51,1>Did it get careless?

<FACE,51,0>What are you doing?

<FACE,51,2>Ha! So much for your big talk.

<FACE,51,0>Arrrrgh! #26!

<FACE,51,1><WAZA,219,1>Quit showing off!

<FACE,51,1><WAZA,105,4>The world belongs to the strong!

<FACE,51,0>Lose to you? Never!

<FACE,51,0>What are you thinking?

<FACE,51,2>Do you see? I'm the best!

<FACE,51,2>The bottom line is that you can't beat me, no matter what you do.

<FACE,51,2>You're wasting your time playing with those wimpy POKÃ©MON.

<FACE,51,0>What... Why?!? This should have been perfect!

<FACE,51,0>Are you happy that you won? Hmph! Sure. Go ahead and brag
about it.

<FACE,51,0>What? What is it that I lack?

<FACE,51,1>Hmph! How could I have only tied against the likes of you?

<FACE,51,2>There you go. Go on home to your mommy.
