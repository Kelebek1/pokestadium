<COL1,PUSH,110,150,255,255>*<COL1,POP>

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP>!!

Not thrown!

<LINE,33>Depending on the moves your POKéMON can
use, there are a number of tactics you can
devise. Yes, I'm talking about your battle
strategy. Now listen closely--I'm about to
discuss the relationship between moves and
tactics.

<LINE,33>Take, for example, the moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

It flew up high!

It dug a hole!

<LINE,33>Both moves protect the user most of the time
from taking damage on the first turn. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>
makes the user fly high into the sky, while
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> lets the user hide underground. On the
next turn, the user POKéMON can strike.

<LINE,33>Let me demonstrate how useful a two-turn
attack can be. Remember that the user won't
take a hit on the first turn.

<LINE,33>Suppose your opponent uses a move such as
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP> that requires the
user to charge up for one turn before
striking. If you immediately use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>,
your opponent's attack won't strike--it'll
strike out!

<LINE,33>Since the user won't be hit for an entire
turn, you can also use these moves just to
waste time.

<LINE,33>For example, you could poison your opponent,
inflicting damage on every turn, then use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>
or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Even though your POKéMON won't be
able to attack, it will avoid getting hit and
damage will still be done to the opponent.

<LINE,33>Similarly, if the opponent uses a protective
move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP>, keep
using two-turn moves to waste time over
the five turns that the protective move
lasts.

<LINE,33>Are you starting to get the hang of it?
There is always a way to beat a POKéMON and
its moves. Try coming up with your own good
plan before you go for a battle.

<LINE,33>If you win a STADIUM battle without any of
your POKéMON fainting, you'll earn a continue.

<LINE,33>Of course that would be wonderful, but don't
just switch POKéMON without first giving it
some thought. Why, you ask? Let me explain.

<LINE,33>When a POKéMON is in trouble, the trainer's
first instinct is to switch it. Keeping your
POKéMON safe certainly is important, but
don't forget that it takes one full turn to
switch.

<LINE,33>That means that the POKéMON you bring
out will be immediately vulnerable to attack.
Ouch!

<LINE,33>And if that attack inflicts major damage, the
new POKéMON could be history in just one
more turn! So instead of helping you,
switching could put you even deeper in the
hole.

<LINE,33>Although it may be painful, you might be
better off to keep the hurt POKéMON in the
battle until it faints. Although that POKéMON
will become useless to you, the next POKéMON
will enter the battle with all of its HP intact.

<LINE,33>I believe that while it's hard to leave a hurt
POKéMON in battle, it's also a sign of love.
#71There are times when one must learn to
endure<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP>

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP>

<LINE,33>Today's topic is "Battling for Beginners."
I'll teach you everything you need to know,
from picking your POKéMON to choosing their
attacks.

This is not a
waste of time!

2 x 1/2 = 1!

(

)

<LINE,33>Greetings! I'm #71EARL<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Whether you want to
become a mighty trainer or just learn how to
win more battles, I'm the man to see! Let's
get started. Today's theme is
"Brushing up on Basic Rules."

<LINE,33>At the STADIUM there are several CUP
tournaments and a variety of battles.
Although each has different restrictions on
which POKéMON may enter, #71the battle rules
are virtually identical<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Let me begin with
these basic rules.

<LINE,33>First, choose six POKéMON from your list of
qualifiers. These six POKéMON will form your
team.

<LINE,33>Choose the three POKéMON that you want to
battle from the six on your team. Once you
have chosen your combatants, the battle will
get underway!

<LINE,33>To win the tournament, you must defeat all of
your opponents.

<LINE,33>OK! Give it your best shot!

<LINE,33>There are several battle rules that every
trainer must obey. It would be best if you
learn the rules that must be followed #71in all
battles<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>Two or more POKéMON cannot be frozen
or asleep at the same time. However, it is
OK for one POKéMON to be asleep and
another one to be frozen.

<LINE,33>You cannot use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SELFDESTRUCT<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EXPLOSION<COL1,POP> when you and your opponent
are down to your last POKéMON. If you
do, you'll automatically lose, even if your
opponent's POKéMON faints. Also,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DESTINY BOND<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> will fail.

<LINE,33>Your POKéMON's evolution is a time for
celebration! It becomes stronger and more
attractive, so what could there possibly be
to complain about? Well for one thing,
POKéMON that evolve by leveling up learn
moves much more slowly than they did before
they evolved.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> can learn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BONE RUSH<COL1,POP>
at Level 41. But its evolved form, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>,
can't learn that move until it reaches
Level 53.

<LINE,33>Even though some CUP tournaments have level
restrictions, you should consider #71canceling
evolution<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> until your POKéMON have learned
some desirable moves.

#71Canceling evolution<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>...

To stop an evolution that is in
progress, simply press the
B Button.

<LINE,33>Before you let your POKéMON evolve, check
when it will learn new moves. No need to evolve
your POKéMON hastily. This kind of preliminary
work is where your battle actually begins.

<LINE,33>POKéMON that evolve using a STONE such as
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>FIRE STONE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>WATER STONE<COL1,POP> often learn
extremely few moves after evolution. Even
though some CUPS have level restrictions,
rushing evolution may not be a good idea.

<LINE,33>Here's an example. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP> can use a
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>FIRE STONE<COL1,POP> to evolve into <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP>. But 
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP> can learn only one move,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FIRE SPIN<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Make your POKéMON learn the moves you want
them to know before you make them evolve.

<LINE,33>On the other hand, there are some moves that
can be learned only after evolution. This
makes for quite a dilemma.

<LINE,33>Moves learned before evolution or those
learned after evolution? Which should be
learned and at what levels? Be sure to weigh
all the options carefully before you evolve
your POKéMON.

<LINE,33>The same goes for POKéMON that evolve
through trading or tameness.
I recommend that you time your
evolutions based on the #71levels at which your
POKéMON learn moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>Now, everyone. Did you know that a POKéMON
can battle while HOLDing an item?

<LINE,33>There are many kinds of HOLD items, such as
those that restore HP and those that
enhance abilities.

<LINE,33>Take, for example, HOLD items that raise the
power of specific types of moves.
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MYSTIC WATER<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BLACK BELT<COL1,POP> are two such
items. HOLDing these items boosts the power
of a POKéMON's moves by about ten percent.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>HARD STONE<COL1,POP> raises
the power of ROCK-type
moves. Suppose we give it to
the WATER-type POKéMON,
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MARILL<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Be careful! According to #71STADIUM rules<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>,
#71each POKéMON in your party must HOLD a
different kind of item <COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Think about your
strategy before you hand out items to your
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>Did you know that two new types
appeared in the Gold and Silver
versions? The DARK- and STEEL- types!

<LINE,33>The DARK-type is tough against the
PSYCHIC-type but weak against the
FIGHTING-type. STEEL-types are unaf-
fected by poison but weak against fire.

<LINE,33>There are also some POKéMON that have
changed types.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGNEMITE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGNETON<COL1,POP> are two such
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>Type match-ups have changed slightly
as well.

<LINE,33>GHOST-type moves are now effective
against PSYCHIC-type POKéMON. BUG-
type moves are not as effective against
POISON-type POKéMON as they were
before. These are some changes.

<LINE,33>Pardon? Oh, you want to know more, do you?
Then off you go to the LIBRARY! There you
will find a whole variety of reference
materials, so it's an excellent place to study
and review data.

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP>

<LINE,33>Instead of being just the ELECTRIC-
type, now they are ELECTRIC- & STEEL-
type POKéMON. What do you think? Does
the enhanced DEFENSE this gives them
make this a welcome change? Or do the
additional match-up weaknesses outweigh
the positive aspects?

<LINE,33>*

<LINE,33>The effects and/or damage ratings for some
moves have also changed. Yes, things are
certainly a bit different since the days of
the POKéMON Red, Blue, and Yellow. Be sure to
learn all you can about these changes! 

<LINE,33>First let's review some moves that have
changed type. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BITE<COL1,POP> became a DARK-type
move, while <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>KARATE CHOP<COL1,POP> became a
FIGHTING move. Likewise, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP> is now a
FLYING-type move.

<LINE,33>The damage ratings for some moves,
such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE-EDGE<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WING ATTACK<COL1,POP>, and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>, have changed.

<LINE,33>The accuracy has also changed for some
moves, such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BLIZZARD<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLWIND<COL1,POP>,
and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROCK THROW<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIND<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CLAMP<COL1,POP>
have changed greatly. These can now
prevent an opponent from switching out!

<LINE,33>The moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> are
now effective for five turns each. They
create barriers on the spot, so they
remain in place even if the target
POKéMON switches out.

<LINE,33>There are added effects and altered
probabilities for other moves, too. Your
homework assignment is to look these up
yourself!

<LINE,33>It is important to try and see what the
moves do.

<LINE,33>In the past, if a target POKéMON's type was
identical to an attack move's type, the
attack move's added effect would never work.

<LINE,33>Now, even if the defending POKéMON's type
is identical to the attack move's type, the
added effect may or may not work.

<LINE,33>That means that the
ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP>
could become paralyzed by
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPARK<COL1,POP>, an ELECTRIC-type
attack.

There are still some exceptions...

<LINE,33>Attacking a POISON-type POKéMON with a
POISON-type move will not poison it! In the
same manner, an ICE-type POKéMON cannot
easily be frozen by an ICE-type move!

<LINE,33>Other than those exceptions, the added
effects of moves will affect all POKéMON,
even if attack and defender's type match.

<LINE,33>The Gold and Silver versions have changed
things a bit.

<LINE,33>Did you know that the POKéMON stat SPECIAL
split into #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>? Oh, you
knew that already? Ah, but perhaps you don't
know everything about it.

<LINE,33>Before, SPECIAL combined both attack and
defense. Now, #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stands for
SPECIAL ATTACK, and #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stands for
SPECIAL DEFENSE. You see? 

This split affects certain moves.

<LINE,33>For example, the move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> used to
sharply raise SPECIAL. Now it strongly
boosts #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> alone. It has no effect on
SPCL.ATK.

<LINE,33>In contrast, the move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GROWTH<COL1,POP> has been 
altered to raise only #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. It doesn't
affect SPCL.DEF at all.

<LINE,33>Strategy is becoming more and more
important, but don't worry. As long as you pay
close attention to my lessons, you should
have no problems.

<LINE,33>At the very least, you should have <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP>
learn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAMETHROWER<COL1,POP> before letting it evolve.

<LINE,33>I'm sure you know about status problems.
They are conditions such as poison, sleep, and
burn that put you at a disadvantage in
battle. But did you also know that there are
other conditions that are similar to status
problems? Allow me to explain.

<LINE,33>ATTRACT could cause infatuation, pre-
venting a male POKéMON from attacking a
female half the time and vice-versa.

<LINE,33>The move NIGHTMARE works only on
sleeping opponents. Each turn, it steals
away a quarter of the victim's HP.

<LINE,33>The move CURSE, when used by a
GHOST-type POKéMON, causes the victim
to lose a quarter of its HP every turn.
These are only a few examples.

<LINE,33>When certain moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEADBUTT<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BITE<COL1,POP> strike first, the defending POKéMON
may flinch and be unable to respond in the
same turn. Yes, this too is a type of added
effect.

<LINE,33>Now this part is very important, so listen
closely. #71Some status problems even affect a
POKéMON's stats<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>!

<LINE,33>For example, not only does a burn cause
damage every turn, it also weakens ATTACK
power.

<LINE,33>Paralysis may immobilize a POKéMON,
but it also sharply reduces SPEED.

<LINE,33>Knowing that, you could deliberately use a
status problem to make up for your own
POKéMON's weaknesses. But regardless of
whether your POKéMON is weak or strong...
Whatever POKéMON you use, your love and
strategy will help you win. 

<LINE,33>Before I conclude, let me tell you about
status problems that wear off during battle.

<LINE,33>There are exactly four: asleep, confused,
having a NIGHTMARE, and frozen. That's
right! Now a frozen POKéMON will thaw out
over time.

That would shock
even <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP>!

<LINE,33>POKéMON are not affected as often by status
problems that match their own types.

<LINE,33>POKéMON and moves come in a variety of
types, such as NORMAL, FIRE, WATER, GRASS,
ELECTRIC, and GHOST. There are seventeen
types in all. The key point is that not only are
POKéMON classified by type, but there are
types for moves, too.

<LINE,33>The combination of the type of POKéMON
under attack and the type of the attack
move is referred to as the type match-up.

<LINE,33>If the type match-up is good, it may be
possible to inflict double the damage. On the
other hand, if the type match-up is bad, an
attack may not have any effect at all.

<LINE,33>Here's an example. WATER-type POKéMON
are strong against FIRE-type attacks but
weak against GRASS-type attacks.

<LINE,33>WATER-type POKéMON:
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TOTODILE<COL1,POP>

<LINE,33>As you can see, a POKéMON's type is
very important when it is under attack.

<LINE,33>We have here a FIRE-type move. It is
super-effective against GRASS-type
POKéMON but weak against WATER-type
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>FIRE-type move: 
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAMETHROWER<COL1,POP>

<LINE,33>As you can see, a move's type becomes
important when it is used for attack.

<LINE,33>The key point here is that there is no link
between the item and the type of POKéMON
using it.

<LINE,33>Exploiting the opponent's weakness... This is
a basic strategy for POKéMON battles. If you
use an attack that matches up favorably
against the defender's type, you can inflict
double the damage.

<LINE,33>For example, let's attack a FLYING-type
POKéMON with an ELECTRIC-type move.

<LINE,33>Ah! See? It picked on a weak spot to cause
double the damage. Even FALKNER, the bird
user, would be aghast! Similarly, attacking a
WATER-type POKéMON with a GRASS-type
move, or attacking a GRASS-type POKéMON
with a FIRE-type move, will be
"super-effective."

<LINE,33>In contrast, if an attack is "not very 
effective,"  the type match-up is bad.
That means the move's impact will be half its
usual level.

<LINE,33>If a move has "no effect," then the type
match-up is simply the worst. The move's
power will drop to zero, so it will be unable to
inflict any damage at all.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SELFDESTRUCT<COL1,POP> is a NORMAL-type
move. It has no effect on GHOST-type
POKéMON because that type match-up is the
worst.

<LINE,33>To avoid such an embarrassing situation, read
and review the material on type match-ups in
the LIBRARY.

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>!!

It's super-effective!

<LINE,33>As you know, POKéMON and moves come in a
variety of types. When a POKéMON is
attacking, if its type is the same as its move
type, the move's impact will increase to
1.5 times its usual level.

<LINE,33>For example, if the
ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> uses
an ELECTRIC-type move, the
attack will have 1.5 times its
usual power.

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERBOLT<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>In the same manner, if a NORMAL-type move is
used by a NORMAL-type POKéMON, the attack
will also be 1.5 times more powerful than it
would be if a POKéMON of a different type
used it. Don't forget this important point!

<LINE,33>Of course, since this combination only
multiplies the power of attack moves by 1.5,
support moves that aren't used for attack
are not affected.

<LINE,33>Lets say <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP> uses a GHOST-type move
such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPITE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>. In such a
case, the move's accuracy or effect will not
be boosted by the identical type combination.

<LINE,33>There are also moves that inflict fixed
amounts of damage. These will not be
multiplied by a factor of 1.5 either. I will
cover this topic in greater detail a bit later,
so please keep this point in mind.

<LINE,33>Support moves--do you use them effectively
in battle? When used correctly, they can
greatly improve your chance of winning. There
are a great deal of support moves. If you
learn to use them properly, you could become
a modern-day ninja!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>Try a move that causes status problems.
If the foe becomes paralyzed, burned, or
falls asleep, the battle will be much easier.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER WAVE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>
are very powerful.

<LINE,33>As a countermeasure, you could use
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP> to prevent status problems for
five turns.

<LINE,33>Or you could use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEAL BELL<COL1,POP>
to cure all your POKéMON
of status problems.

<LINE,33>There are some stats, such as ATTACK,
DEFENSE, and accuracy, that can be
temporarily affected by moves during battle.

<LINE,33>Use moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BELLY DRUM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWORDS DANCE<COL1,POP>
on your own POKéMON before attacking. These
moves strongly boost ATTACK power.

<LINE,33>To counteract such moves, use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HAZE<COL1,POP>. It will
return any POKéMON stat change back to
normal. However, be aware that this move will
work on both your POKéMON and the opponent,
and it will reset stats regardless of whether
the ability is up or down.

<LINE,33>Ah, yes. Any altered stat will return to
normal if the POKéMON is switched out. It may
be effective to obstruct switching by using a
move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPIDER WEB<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Two other moves that you may find useful are
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> halves
the damage from physical attacks over five
turns, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> halves the damage
from special attacks.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FORESIGHT<COL1,POP> is another good move. It returns
the opponent's evasiveness to normal. Sigh...
There are far too many moves for me to
describe them all. Your homework assignment
is to study the rest on your own.

<LINE,33>When you attack, how do you choose which
moves to use? Do you base your decision
solely on the move's POWER? I recommend that
you consider moves that have #71added
effects<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
Truth be told, they can be very convenient.

<LINE,33>For example, there are moves that give the
target status problems. These moves don't
just inflict damage, they also cause status
problems like paralysis, poison, freezing,
burn, and confusion.

<LINE,30><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIZZY PUNCH<COL1,POP> is a good example. It has a
one-in-five chance of confusing the
target--a very nice bonus!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIZZY PUNCH<COL1,POP>!!

#71Dmg/Cnf<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>

G' night

<LINE,33>There are also moves that inflict
damage and lower stats like DEFENSE and
evasiveness.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP> has a one-in-ten
chance of reducing the target's SPCL.DEF.

<LINE,33>Some moves raise the attacker's stats after
inflicting damage on the target.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STEEL WING<COL1,POP> is one example. It has a
one-in-ten chance of raising the user's
DEFENSE.

<LINE,33>Are you getting all this? Moves with added
effects can be very convenient. I suggest
you try them yourself.

<LINE,33>POKéMON moves are not only for attack.
There are also those that heal POKéMON. Let
me describe some to you.

<LINE,33>First, moves that restore HP include
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RECOVER<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MILK DRINK<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOFTBOILED<COL1,POP>. Each
of these restores HP by exactly one-half the
maximum HP.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP>
are HP-restoring moves that vary in effect-
iveness depending on the time they are used.

<LINE,33>In battle, however, these moves restore
HP by one-half the maximum HP no matter what
time of day it is.

<LINE,33>Oh, yes. There are also <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LEECH LIFE<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP>
and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ABSORB<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>But it's not only about restoring HP. There
are moves that get rid of status problems,
too. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEAL BELL<COL1,POP>, for example, eliminates all
status problems for all the POKéMON on your
party.

<LINE,33>The move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP> fully restores HP and gets rid
of any status problems. Your POKéMON sleeps
for two turns to rid itself of problems like
burn and paralysis.

<LINE,33>Simultaneously, any stats that
were affected by problems--
such as a lowered ATTACK due
to a burn or reduced SPEED due
to paralysis--will be fixed.

<LINE,33>However, even <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP> can't change stats that
were altered by other support moves or by
other means. So ATTACK raised by using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEDITATE<COL1,POP> would remain unchanged, as would
accuracy reduced by an opponent's <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLASH<COL1,POP>. 

<LINE,33>Incidentally, to restore altered stats, you
can either switch POKéMON or use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HAZE<COL1,POP>. I 
already described this move in my lesson on
#71support moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Remember?

<LINE,33>Do you know about set damage attacks?
#71These moves inflict fixed amounts of
damage regardless of the user's ATTACK
power and the target's DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
Let me give you some examples.

<LINE,33>The NORMAL-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SONICBOOM<COL1,POP>
always inflicts 20HP damage.

<LINE,33>Similarly, the DRAGON-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DRAGON RAGE<COL1,POP> consistently inflicts 40HP
damage.

<LINE,33>The GHOST-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP>
and the FIGHTING-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP> also work similarly. These
moves hit the target with the same
amount of HP damage as the user's level.

<LINE,33>How were my lectures for the
TRAINER CLASS? Were they interesting? If
you're confident, try out our tests. This will
be it for now!

<LINE,33>There is something I need to tell you.

<LINE,33>Even if your POKéMON's type and its
attack-move type are identical, the
move's power will not be multiplied x 1.5.

<LINE,33>The move's power will also not change,
even if the type match-up is good or bad.
In other words, the move will be neither
"super-effective" nor
"not very effective."

The move also will not hit a weak spot.

<LINE,33>Of course, since they are #71set damage<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> moves,
it's only natural that their power is not
doubled, multiplied by 1.5 or halved.

<LINE,33>That said, #71whether the move works or not
does depend on type match-ups<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP> is a
FIGHTING-type move, so it won't work on
GHOST-type POKéMON. In that regard, it's
no different from other moves. Similarly,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STRENGTH<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGA PUNCH<COL1,POP> are also
ineffective against GHOST-type POKéMON.
Be aware of this important point.

<LINE,33>Be sure to check
the opposing POKéMON's type.

<LINE,33>Did you know that there are two kinds of
attacks? #71Physical attacks<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and #71special
attacks<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. The type of move determines
whether an attack is physical or special. This
is a very important point to remember.

<LINE,33>The amount of damage inflicted is determined
based on the difference between physical and
special attacks.

<LINE,33>The amount of damage inflicted by a
#71physical attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> depends on the
attacker's #71ATTACK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and the target's
#71DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stats.

<LINE,33>The amount of damage caused by a
#71special attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> depends on the
attacker's #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and the target's
#71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>Quite simple, isn't it? Now you see the
relationship between POKéMON stats and the
power of moves. Now let me explain what types
of moves would be physical and what would be
special.

<LINE,33>Every NORMAL-, FIGHTING-, BUG-,
FLYING-, GROUND-, ROCK-, GHOST-,
POISON-, and STEEL-type move is a
physical attack.

<LINE,33>Every FIRE-, WATER-, ELECTRIC-,
GRASS-, ICE-, PSYCHIC-, DRAGON-, and
DARK-type move is a special attack.

<LINE,33>Consider BUG-type moves. Since
they are physical attacks, they
will be more powerful when used
by a POKéMON with a high ATTACK
stat.

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGAHORN<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>Did you understand the distinction between
physical and special attacks? Whether you
understand or not will make a huge difference
in battle.

<LINE,33>You do know that a POKéMON can go into
battle while HOLDing an item? Next, we'll delve
a little further into this topic with a lesson
I call "Introducing Items." I will teach you
how to battle by combining moves and items.

<LINE,33>#71Combining moves and items<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>...
What could this mean?

<LINE,33>If a POKéMON is HOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>PSNCUREBERRY<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>PRZCUREBERRY<COL1,POP>, it will automatically use that
item during battle to heal itself of poison or
paralysis. I suggest that you deliberately
combine such items with certain moves.

<LINE,33>Take, for example, the DRAGON-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OUTRAGE<COL1,POP>. Although it is powerful, the user
becomes confused after two to three turns.

<LINE,33>But try making the POKéMON using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OUTRAGE<COL1,POP>
HOLD a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BITTER BERRY<COL1,POP>. As soon as the
POKéMON becomes confused, it will auto-
matically use the held item to get rid of its
confusion. Isn't that convenient?

There are other combinations, too.

<LINE,33>Consider the Psychic-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>.
If you were to equip a POKéMON that knows
this move with a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> in advance...

<LINE,33>When it falls asleep, its HP will be restored
and any status problems eliminated. Then it
will use the <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> to wake up. So
instead of having to wait two turns, it will be
ready to battle right away!

<LINE,33>This move is sure to annoy your foe. The only
saving grace from your foe's point of view is
that <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> can be used only once.

If tired, use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>!

#71Rise and shine!<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>

<LINE,33>Under #71STADIUM rules<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>, #71your party
POKéMON are not allowed to HOLD the same
kinds of items. The HOLD items must all be
different<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Therefore, you should carefully
consider the combinations of items and
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>Normally, status problems do not double up.
However, I imagine you have experienced
situations in which a POKéMON suffers from
more than one kind of status problem.
I personally have had a POKéMON that was
both paralyzed and confused at the same
time.

<LINE,33>Status problems can be largely divided into
two categories. The categorization depends
on whether the status problem is #71indicated
or not<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>#71Those that are indicated on the screen<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
are poison, paralysis, burn, sleep, and
freeze. These are the #71real status
problems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>#71Those that aren't indicated on the
screen are similar in nature to real
status problems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. These include
CONFUSION, CURSE, NIGHTMARE,
ATTRACT, flinch, and LEECH SEED.

<LINE,33>This is an important part. Those conditions
that are indicated on the screen
--the real status problems-- do not double
up. If a POKéMON already has a status
problem, it can't be hit with another one.

<LINE,33>For example, a sleeping POKéMON's status
would be indicated as "Sp". In that
situation, it is not vulnerable to any other
status problem such as poison, paralysis,
burn, or freeze.

<LINE,33>However, a POKéMON with a status problem is
still susceptible to any other kind of
abnormality. For instance, a frozen POKéMON
can still be confused or made infatuated.

<LINE,33>Incidentally, #71it is possible for a POKéMON
to be afflicted with multiple kinds of abnor-
malities that aren't real status problems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>So a POKéMON can be simultaneously afflicted
with such conditions as CURSE, NIGHTMARE,
CONFUSION, and ATTRACT.

<LINE,33>However, these abnormalities are entirely
lifted if the affected POKéMON switches out.
Please don't forget that.

<LINE,33>(Of course, if it were me, I would use
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP> to make it impossible for the
affected POKéMON to switch! Ho, ho, ho...)

<LINE,33>Here's another important point. Any move
that could cause a burn will thaw out a frozen
POKéMON. The heat causes the ice to melt,
naturally.

<LINE,33>You already know that some POKéMON have two
types. For example, consider a GRASS- &
POISON-type POKéMON. The power of its
GRASS- and POISON-type moves will be
multiplied by 1.5. Ah, you knew that already?
Good. Then I'll explain further.

<LINE,33>A dual-type POKéMON also has two sets of
type match-ups. This is especially important
when it is attacked.

<LINE,33>Do you know type match-ups? Double damage
is inflicted if a move is "super-effective."
If it's "not very effective," the power is
halved. If it has "no effect," its power is
zero.

<LINE,33>When a dual-type POKéMON is attacked, the
two type match-ups are multiplied. This is how
it works: Type 1 x Type 2. Perhaps I should
explain a bit further.

<LINE,33>Say a dual-type POKéMON is hit by an attack.
Also assume that the type match-up of the
attack move is good against both types. In
this case, Type 1 takes double damage, and
Type 2 takes double damage. Now, multiply the
two damage multipliers: 2 x 2 = 4. In other
words, the move's power is quadrupled!

<LINE,33>For example, let's say a FIRE- & ROCK-type
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGCARGO<COL1,POP> is hit by a WATER-type attack. As a
WATER attack is "super-effective" against
both POKéMON types, the damage would be
four times greater
than normal.

Quadruple!

<LINE,33>The opposite could also occur. Consider this: 
Type 1 halves the damage, and Type 2
halves the damage. Multiplying these, we get
1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. So in this case, the POKéMON
would be hit with only 1/4 the usual power.

<LINE,33>An example would be a BUG- & POISON-type
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SPINARAK<COL1,POP> hit by a GRASS-type attack that's
"not very effective" against either type.

A mere scrape!

<LINE,33>How about this situation? Type 1 takes
double the damage; Type 2 halves the damage.
Multiplying the damage multipliers, 2 x 1/2,
we get the combined damage multiplier of one. 
In this case, the poor Type 1 match-up is
rectified by the favorable Type 2 match-up.

<LINE,33>The WATER- & ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>LANTURN<COL1,POP>
and similar POKéMON manage to protect
themselves against ELECTRIC-type attacks.

<LINE,33>This one should be obvious. Type 1 takes
double the damage; Type 2 takes no damage at
all. In this situation, the multiplication of
damage multipliers is 2 x 0 = 0. In other words,
the move will have "no effect."

<LINE,33>Let's say a POISON- & FLYING-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GOLBAT<COL1,POP>
is attacked by <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, a GROUND-type
move. According to type match-ups, POISON-
type POKéMON take double damage from
GROUND-type attacks. But because GROUND-
type attacks have no effect on FLYING-type
POKéMON, the multiplier is 2 x 0 = 0. The
GROUND-type attack can't inflict any damage.

<LINE,33>As I have just shown, dual-type POKéMON
may have more weaknesses and/or cleverly
cover for weaknesses. This is just one of the
wonderful mysteries that surround POKéMON. 

<LINE,33>OK! This lesson is on everyone's favorite
topic: "Match-up Math"! I will show you how
much damage can vary due to POKéMON types
and type match-ups.

<LINE,33>Previously, I told you about POKéMON that
have two types. Did you understand that
topic?

<LINE,33>A dual-type POKéMON multiplies the damage
multipliers of two type match-ups. At most,
the damage could be quadrupled. At worst, it
may not inflict any damage. Obviously, the
amount of damage inflicted could vary a lot.

<LINE,33>Actually, there are other multipliers!

<LINE,33>If the POKéMON's type and the move
type are the same, the move's attack
power is multiplied by 1.5.

Hitting a weak spot means double damage.

These factors are also multiplied.

<LINE,33>Let me give you an example. Let's say an
ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP> is battling a
WATER- & FLYING-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GYARADOS<COL1,POP>.

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP> used <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERBOLT<COL1,POP>!

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP>
used an
ELECTRIC
-type move,
which matches
its own type.

The ELECTRIC
-move strikes a
WATER- &
FLYING-type
POKéMON. The
combined damage
multiplier is
2 x 2 = 4, or
x 4 the damage.

And let's
say the
move
strikes a
weak spot.

<LINE,33>If the attack becomes a "critical hit."

<LINE,33>Multiplying these factors out we get:
1.5 x 4 x 2 = 12 Ka-pow! That's twelve times
the normal damage! So if you're lucky, an
attack could inflict up to #71twelve times<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> the
move's normal damage!

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>!

vs

<LINE,33>If a move's base power is 10, its power would
be multiplied by 12 to make it 120. Isn't that
spectacular? That's why it's critical that you
pay attention to type match-ups in battle.

<LINE,33>Do you remember the set damage moves?
Those are the moves that inflict fixed
amounts of damage regardless of the
attacker's and the target's types.

<LINE,33>Moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SONICBOOM<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DRAGON RAGE<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP>...
Do you remember them now?

<LINE,33>With these moves, there is #71no need to worry
about ATTACK or SPCL.ATK stats<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Here's why.

<LINE,33>For example, let's say a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>
uses a GHOST-type move. The
move's power is multiplied by 1.5.
However, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>'s ATTACK
stat is relatively low.

<LINE,33>In that case, it may be more effective to
inflict a set amount of damage using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>When is a move most effective? Find out, then
use your moves accordingly. Then, you'll be
ready for the GYM LEADER CLASS!

<LINE,33>Let me explain some key points on set
damage moves.

<LINE,33>The power stays the same even if stats
are raised or lowered by support moves.

<LINE,33>However, it is possible to change
accuracy or evasiveness using support
moves.

<LINE,33>Even if <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> is
used, the damage inflicted by set
damage moves remains unaffected.

<LINE,33>When I was discussing moves and tactics in
the TRAINER CLASS, I covered the two moves
of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Do you remember?

<LINE,33>I taught you that both moves avoid damage on
the first turn, and I described some tactics
that take advantage of that fact.

<LINE,33>Of course, even these moves do not protect
the user against status abnormalities such
as CURSE or POISON.

<LINE,33>But there's more. There are actually moves
that can strike a POKéMON while it's using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Moves that can strike a
POKéMON that's using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>They include <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TWISTER<COL1,POP>
and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLWIND<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>In particular, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TWISTER<COL1,POP> double
in power when the target uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>If a <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP> is blowing when a
POKéMON uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>, the POKéMON will be
hurt.

<LINE,33>There are also moves that
can attack a POKéMON
that's using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>They include <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>
and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FISSURE<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>The moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>
are doubled in power when the target
POKéMON is using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Oh yes, even if the opponent is using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP>
or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CLAMP<COL1,POP>, it's still possible to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>. However, your POKéMON will still be hurt
by these restraining attacks while flying or
underground.

<LINE,33>So, as you have seen, the range of tactics
open to you has widened even further. That's
why it is so important to try to predict what
your opponent might do in battle.

<LINE,33>A key point for winning at the STADIUM is to
teach your POKéMON a variety of move types.
Let me explain.

<LINE,33>If a POKéMON's type matches the move type,
the move's power is multiplied by 1.5,
correct? But this could trip you up. If a
POKéMON has only this one type of move, it
would be at a great disadvantage against a
POKéMON with a poor type match-up.

<LINE,33>For example, take the FIRE-type
POKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP>. It certainly is a tough
POKéMON. But what if its opponent is a
WATER-type POKéMON? If <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP>
knows only FIRE-type moves, it can inflict
only half the usual damage on the opponent.

<LINE,33>What if it also knew <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERPUNCH<COL1,POP>? Ah, yes.
This inflicts double the damage. You could
catch your opponent off guard.

<LINE,33>If <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP> also knew the move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, it could hit FIRE-, POISON-,
ELECTRIC-, ROCK-, and STEEL-type POKéMON
with "super-effective" attacks.

<LINE,33>Think of balance when making POKéMON
learn moves.

<LINE,33>In CUP competition, you will face a wide
variety of POKéMON. It would be very hard to
win all the battles without first preparing
your team to contend with every type of
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>It is extremely important to balance your
team with a variety of POKéMON.

<LINE,33>In conclusion... The key to battling is #71to use
different types of POKéMON and moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If
you heed this advice when assembling your
team, I am certain you will conquer the
STADIUM tournaments. On to victory!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERPUNCH<COL1,POP>!!

#71Super-effective!<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>

<LINE,33>An unnecessary POKéMON switch could be
disastrous. Haven't I taught you that?
Because switching uses up a turn, the
opponent may hit the switched-in POKéMON as
soon as it appears.

<LINE,33>But there is such a thing as waste-free
switching. What do you suppose that could be?

<LINE,33>Here's one example. #71Switch in a POKéMON
that is unaffected by the opponent's attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
This switch is one that gives priority to
defense.

<LINE,33>Try this scenario. Let's say your opponent
sends out a GROUND-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DUGTRIO<COL1,POP>. It's
highly likely that this POKéMON will know
powerful GROUND-type attacks such as
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>In that case, switch in a FLYING-type
POKéMON. Because a GROUND-type move has no
effect on FLYING-type POKéMON, you can
switch in without taking any damage.

<LINE,33>Even if the opponent launches
an attack at the switched-in
POKéMON, if it is unaffected,
then the switching wasn't a
waste of time.

<LINE,33>Switching in this way gives you a
distinct advantage. The opponent's best
moves are made totally ineffective against
you. Of course, this might prompt your
opponent to switch out, as well.

<LINE,33>This is why switching in battle requires some
careful consideration.

<LINE,33>If you master switching, you can master
battles.

<LINE,33>In battle, it is extremely important to be
able to analyze both your POKéMON's
situation and that of your opponent's
POKéMON.

<LINE,33>Let me explain what I mean in detail.

<LINE,33>If a PSYCHIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP> uses
the PSYCHIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>,
the move's power is multiplied
by 1.5.

<LINE,33>That is the expected conclusion. However,
that assumption could come back to haunt
you.

<LINE,33>For example, what if the opponent were a
NORMAL-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>?

<LINE,33>The type match-up against
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP> is neither good nor
bad. The problem lies with
POKéMON stats.

<LINE,33>Do you know <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>'s stats? While
its #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is high, its #71DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is
very low.

<LINE,33>Though <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP> is good at PSYCHIC-type
moves, they do little damage against <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>This is why you must consider the stats of
opposing POKéMON along with type match-ups
in battle.

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP>!

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>!

<LINE,33>Welcome to the ELITE FOUR CLASS!
(This student must like me...)

<LINE,33>Welcome to the ELITE FOUR CLASS!
(This student must like me...) Let's get
started right away. Now I will cover a very
interesting topic: "Double-Duty Damage"?

<LINE,33>Have you ever noticed a POKéMON HOLDing an
item even though you never gave one to it?

<LINE,33>Actually, #71some wild POKéMON are already
HOLDing items<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. In very rare cases, they may
even be HOLDing exceedingly rare items.

<LINE,33>For example, my own experience tells me that
about one in every four wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP> HOLDs
a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MYSTERYBERRY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>In very rare cases, a
wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP> may be
HOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MOON STONE<COL1,POP>.
Wouldn't that
be wonderful?

(I certainly would like to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THIEF<COL1,POP> on it!)

<LINE,33>Also, a POKéMON that is traded from Red,
Blue, or Yellow into the world of Gold and
Silver will always be HOLDing an item of
some sort. What a great deal!

<LINE,33>The item differs from POKéMON to POKéMON.
For example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TANGELA<COL1,POP> is always HOLDing
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BITTERBERRY<COL1,POP>!

<LINE,33>The kind of item held by a POKéMON doesn't
change if the POKéMON evolves. Also, the
POKéMON won't switch its held item with
another item.

<LINE,33>The item a wild POKéMON prefers won't
change. Let's say you catch a wild NIDORAN♀
and evolve it into <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDOQUEEN<COL1,POP>.
The evolved forms will still be HOLDing the
same item as the unevolved NIDORAN♀. Its
held item will always be <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>TM43 DETECT<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>If you catch a wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP>, its held item
won't change if it evolves into a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDOQUEEN<COL1,POP>.
The item it HOLDs will still remain the same as
for <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP> , a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BERRY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>There are also items that are held only by
specific POKéMON. For instance, there is an
item that is held only by wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>KADABRA<COL1,POP> in the
Yellow version. Can you find others?

<LINE,33>Before I finish,#71 I have to tell you about
items that are useless unless held by specific
POKéMON<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. I'll give you just a few examples.

<LINE,33>One example is <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP>. This item
doubles the power of special attacks but
only if it is held by a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>The HOLD item <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP> is only for
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>. It doubles the
power of physical attacks. There are
others too.

<LINE,33>(Hmm... I wish I had one...)

<LINE,33>If the move's and the POKéMON's types match,
damage is x 1.5. If the move's type match-up
is good against both of the target's types,
damage is x 4. For a critical hit, it is x 2.

<LINE,33>By multiplying all these damage multipliers
together, we get: 1.5 x 4 x 2 = 12 times the
damage. I explained this part earlier.

<LINE,33>Actually, there are two other multipliers that
may also be applied. Let me explain.

Number 1, the weather.

<LINE,33>For five turns after using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>,
the power of FIRE-type moves is x 1.5.

<LINE,33>Likewise, for five turns after using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>, the power of WATER-type
moves is multiplied by 1.5.

<LINE,33>Three moves change the weather: <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>. Don't worry--
these weather conditions will not double or
triple. Let's see what happens to the damage
multiplier of 12 if these occur. The multiplier
is 12 x 1.5 = 18. So, with the right conditions,
a move could inflict x 18 the usual damage.

Number 2, held items.

<LINE,33>Certain items, like <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MIRACLE SEED<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>CHARCOAL<COL1,POP>, boost specific types of moves 
x 1.1. This multiplier also applies to the
combined damage, including the weather.

<LINE,33>There are also items that affect only
specific kinds of POKéMON. For instance,
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> doubles the power of
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>'s special attacks.

<LINE,33>Let's see how the combined damage multiplier
works. Consider a case in which a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> HOLDs a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Wow, that certainly is extreme. So be wary of
these three POKéMON: <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP>,
and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>.

Pika? Pika?

<LINE,33>The PSYCHIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYWAVE<COL1,POP> is an
interesting move. At its weakest, it can
inflict only 1HP damage. At its
strongest, it inflicts damage that is
1.5 times the normal level.

<LINE,33>Also, if a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIND READER<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LOCK-ON<COL1,POP>
is used, the attack move in the next turn will
strike even a flying POKéMON, or a POKéMON
under the ground.

<LINE,33>Do you use support moves? These include
moves that lower the opponent's stats,
induce sleep, cause confusion, and so on. I
love them. Did you know that, by and large,
there are two major kinds of support moves
that are intended for use against
opponents?

<LINE,33>There are two types of support moves.
Ones that:
-Work regardless of the type match-up
-Are affected by the type match-up

<LINE,33>You do remember type match-ups, I hope? For
example, PSYCHIC-type moves have zero
effect on DARK-type POKéMON. So in this
case, moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>
won't work.

<LINE,33>However, there are also support moves that
aren't affected by type match-ups. These
moves will work on any type of POKéMON. For
example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPNOSIS<COL1,POP> will make even DARK-type
POKéMON sleep.

<LINE,33>There are other exceptional moves besides
these, so please do be careful.



<LINE,33>There are also support moves that are
affected by type match-ups. Depending on
the POKéMON's type, these moves may not
work at all.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER WAVE<COL1,POP> will never have
any effect on GROUND-type POKéMON. After
all, the type match-up of an ELECTRIC-type
move on a GROUND-type POKéMON is the
worst--it won't have any effect.

<LINE,33>In a similar fashion, the POISON-type
support moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>POISON GAS<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TOXIC<COL1,POP>, and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>POISONPOWDER<COL1,POP> have no effect on STEEL-type
POKéMON. There are other support moves of
this nature.

<LINE,33>So how do you tell these two kinds of support
moves apart? Look at the message that
appears if a move doesn't work. It could say,
"It didn't affect (POKéMON)" or
"It doesn't affect (POKéMON)."

<LINE,33>If "It didn't affect (POKéMON)"
appears, your move was not affected by
the type match-up. It just failed.

<LINE,33>If "It doesn't affect (POKéMON)"
appears, your move is affected by the
type match-up. It will never work on
that type of POKéMON.

It gets confused!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>In general, a speedy POKéMON
enjoys an advantage since it can attack
first. However, you can make up for slowness
by using the right moves and tactics. Let me
share some of my best tactics.

If you wish to attack before your opponent...

<LINE,33>The three moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>QUICK ATTACK<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EXTREMESPEED<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MACH PUNCH<COL1,POP> enable
the user to attack first.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AGILITY<COL1,POP> boosts the user's SPEED.

<LINE,33>You can also lower the opponent's SPEED
by using a support move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SCARY FACE<COL1,POP>
or the added effects of a move such as
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ICY WIND<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Paralyzing the opponent also sharply
reduces its SPEED.

Use these tactics to move before your foe.

<LINE,33>If your POKéMON can act first, you won't
have to fear moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAIN SPLIT<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP>. Just make sure you knock out the
opponent before it can use these moves.

<LINE,33>You can also avoid <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DESTINY BOND<COL1,POP>, a move that
makes the foe faint if the user faints. Again,
just defeat the foe before it can use this.

<LINE,33>Incidentally, #71there are also moves and
tactics that don't depend on SPEED or which
POKéMON moves first<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Let's examine some of
these.

<LINE,33>The move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> causes both POKéMON
to faint three turns later. However, its
effect wears off if the POKéMON switch out.
Therefore, you should make it impossible
for the opponent to switch beforehand.

<LINE,33>If a POKéMON uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIDE<COL1,POP>, it takes whatever
damage the foe inflicts for two to three
turns, then releases that built-up energy to
inflict double the damage it's taken.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>COUNTER<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIRROR COAT<COL1,POP> are retaliation
moves. One strikes back with double damage
against physical attacks, one against special
attacks. Also, these moves are always used in
the bottom of the turn after the foe's move.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FUTURE SIGHT<COL1,POP> is an attack move that strikes
two turns after use. It is not affected by
type match-ups. Therefore, its effect is not
multiplied by 1.5 if used by a PSYCHIC-type
POKéMON. It works on all
POKéMON types including
DARK and FIGHTING.

<LINE,33>That about wraps it up. Pardon?
You want to know more?
Well, um... 
Oh, look at the time! 
I have to go!

<LINE,33>A POKéMON that has learned different types
of moves should be able to battle effectively
against any type of POKéMON. You'll come to
appreciate this, I'm sure.

<LINE,33>Perhaps I should use some examples to
show you what I mean?

1 - #71Teach a POKéMON a move it hates<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>

<LINE,33>Try teaching your POKéMON moves that they
themselves are vulnerable to. For example,
take a WATER-type POKéMON that is weak
against ELECTRIC moves. A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>STARMIE<COL1,POP>,
perhaps. We'll teach it the ELECTRIC move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>If it battles an opponent of the same type,
this move gives it a strong edge. Even better,
it can catch the opponent completely off
guard.

<LINE,33>There are many other combinations.
-<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> with the ICE-type <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BLIZZARD<COL1,POP>
-<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ARBOK<COL1,POP> with the GROUND-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>...

2 - #71Aim for the weak spots of POKéMON<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>

<LINE,33>Teach your POKéMON a move that will exploit
the weak point of a POKéMON that has a type
match-up advantage. For example, WATER-
type POKéMON are weak against ELECTRIC
attacks. So, teach a WATER POKéMON a 
GROUND-type move, which is super-effective.

<LINE,33>A foe who chooses to use an ELECTRIC type
against your WATER type will be surprised. A
GROUND-type move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> that the
ELECTRIC-type hates is suddenly sprung...

There are other combinations, too.

<LINE,33>The GRASS-type POKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP> is weak
against ICE-type attacks. A good remedy
would be to teach it a STEEL-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>IRON TAIL<COL1,POP>, which is "super-effective"
against ICE-type POKéMON.

<LINE,33>The DARK-type POKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>UMBREON<COL1,POP> is at a
disadvantage against FIGHTING-type
POKéMON. So teach it a PSYCHIC-type move
like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>. FIGHTING-type POKéMON are
weak against PSYCHIC-type moves, correct?

<LINE,33>Using these kinds of methods, it may be
possible to take on a POKéMON that has a
type advantage. At least it never hurts to
try.

ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FLAAFFY<COL1,POP>!

But here comes an
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>!

Ah, yes.

<LINE,33>Have you heard the term "Combo"?  It refers
to a combination of moves. Today, I will teach
you some very effective combos.

<LINE,33>For example, try this combo: <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DEFENSE CURL<COL1,POP>
and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP>. The ROCK-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP>,
when used after <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DEFENSE CURL<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>Or try these. I call them sure-hit combos.

<LINE,33>First, use a move that ensures that the next
attack will hit. Try a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LOCK-ON<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIND READER<COL1,POP>. Complete the combo with
an inaccurate but powerful move such as
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ZAP CANNON<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DYNAMICPUNCH<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>The power of the combo will be incredible. I
would switch to a POKéMON that is hopefully
unaffected by the attack move's type.

<LINE,33>Now, endurance combos. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> leaves the
user with at least 1HP after any attack.
Combine it with moves that become more
powerful if the user's HP falls, such as
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAIL<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAIN SPLIT<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>However, these combos are vulnerable if your
POKéMON is attacked first. I think the smart
thing to do is to raise your SPEED in advance.

<LINE,33>Sleeper combos... These are combos that
involve healing moves. If HP is low after using
a move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BELLY DRUM<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CURSE<COL1,POP>, use
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>It would be even more effective if the sleep-
ing POKéMON had an attack move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SLEEP
TALK<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SNORE<COL1,POP> or was HOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Creeper combos... Start with a move that
inflicts damage every turn, such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TOXIC<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>The last half of the combo could be a move
that causes a status problem like confusion
or sleep. Or you could concentrate on your
own defense. Either way, you're certain to
infuriate your opponent!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP> + <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIND<COL1,POP>!!



<LINE,33>The <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PURSUIT<COL1,POP> combo. The DARK-type move
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PURSUIT<COL1,POP> inflicts double damage if the
opponent switches out.

<LINE,33>So, the thing to do beforehand is to use
a move that prompts switching.

<LINE,33>For example, lead with a move like
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>. Moves that
cause status problems are also effective.

<LINE,33>There are many other combos. Try to devise
your own! (If you do, keep them a secret to
share with just me.)

<LINE,33>Did you know that there are moves that vary
with the target's status or the weather? And
there are combos that depend on the
situation. Let me explain.

Combinations with the opponent's status

<LINE,33>If the opponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STOMP<COL1,POP> it to inflict double the damage.

<LINE,33>Against a sleeping opponent,
moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHTMARE<COL1,POP> and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP> work superbly.
If the opponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>,
these moves will come as
nasty surprises.

<LINE,33>Next, combos that work with the weather.
First, combos that start with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>When the sunlight turns harsh after using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>The power of FIRE-type moves is
multiplied by 1.5. In contrast, the power
of WATER-type moves is halved.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP> and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP> will provide double the usual
HP-restoring power. In STADIUM, these
moves will fully heal HP.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP>, which normally takes two
turns, will be useable every turn. In
contrast, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>'s accuracy will drop,
so it would hit only about half the time.

Also, POKéMON will not become frozen.

When it is pouring after using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>The power of WATER-type moves is
multiplied by 1.5. Conversely, the power of
FIRE-type moves is cut in half.

<LINE,33>The HP-recovery moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>,
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP> are affected
by the downpour. Their performance is cut
in half. In STADIUM, these moves will only
heal one quarter of the 
user's maximum HP.

<LINE,33>The power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> will be cut in
half, but <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> won't miss.

<LINE,33>If your POKéMON is weak against FIRE-type
moves, you can use this move for added
defense. Incidentally, a weather-altering
move never fails, so there's nothing to worry
about when using it.

<LINE,33>Now, here are some combos that can be
performed under special situations. Quite
often, a single POKéMON won't be able to do
them. If so, switch to another POKéMON.

<LINE,33>For example, make <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TOGEPI<COL1,POP> use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP>,
then switch it with <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANKEY<COL1,POP>. Make this
POKéMON use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THRASH<COL1,POP>. This will prevent
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANKEY<COL1,POP> from becoming confused after it uses
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THRASH<COL1,POP>. This is an example of a combo
featuring a move that remains in effect if
the user switches out.

<LINE,33>Combos represent the skill and wisdom
of trainers. I hope you will try to create
your own beautiful combos like the ones I
demonstrated for you.

<LINE,33>If you are willing to waste one turn to switch
POKéMON in battle, it is best to bring out a
POKéMON that is completely unaffected by
the opponent's attack. That is the
defense-first switching style which appears
to be popular now. I believe I taught you this
already?

<LINE,33>However, it goes without saying that you will
never win by just defending. You should
consider #71offense-minded switching<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>Let me illustrate. Let's assume you have an
ELECTRIC-type POKéMON out.

Pika!

And let's assume the foe uses a GROUND type.

Cuuu!

<LINE,33>Your ELECTRIC type is at an obvious dis-
advantage. Your first instinct would probably
be to switch it with a FLYING type that is
unaffected by GROUND-type moves... Ahem!
Let's stop and think about this.

<LINE,33>While it is true that the FLYING type is
unaffected by GROUND-type attacks, the
type match-up of the FLYING type against
the GROUND type is neutral. In other words,
you won't be able to attack effectively.

<LINE,33>If I were you, I would not hesitate to send
out a GRASS-type POKéMON.

Suuuuun!

<LINE,33>GROUND-type moves can only inflict half
their usual damage on GRASS-type POKéMON.
On the other hand, GRASS-type attacks
inflict double the usual damage on GROUND-
type POKéMON. This is what I mean by
#71offense-minded switching<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Wonderful!

<LINE,33>However, do keep in mind that the opponent's
attacks are only reduced in power, not made
ineffective.

<LINE,33>Do you choose to give priority to defense or
take offense even at the expense of some
damage? You should evaluate your current
situation before choosing between them.

<LINE,33>Hm? It's no good unless you have different
kinds of POKéMON.

<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SUNKERN<COL1,POP> learns <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP> at
Level 46. However, if it evolves into
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SUNFLORA<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>Attacking the type match-up weaknesses of
POKéMON is a basic strategy. However,
depending on the situation, doing so isn't
necessarily the best course of action. Allow
me to explain.

<LINE,33>For example, consider a battle between a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>.

NORMAL

WATER/FLYING

<LINE,33>Let's assume <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP> used a TM to learn the
ELECTRIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>. You would
probably consider yourself lucky. After all,
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>'s two types, WATER and FLYING,
are both weak against ELECTRIC-type
attacks. That means the ELECTRIC-type
move will have its power quadrupled.

<LINE,33>That certainly sounds wonderful. But hold on
just one second. Don't be fooled by the
situation's allure. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> is a special
attack. That means the amount of damage is
determined by the stats SPCL.ATK and
SPCL.DEF.

<LINE,33>Let's check these stats. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP>'s SPCL.ATK
is rather low. On the other hand, consider
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>'s SPCL.DEF. It is very high. All of a
sudden, the move loses its appeal.
Furthermore, I don't think <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> is a move
that will hit very often.

<LINE,33>In this case, rather than exploiting a type
match-up weakness, it may be better to use a
NORMAL-type move. The power of the
NORMAL-type move will be multiplied by
1.5 because of the type match. For example,
moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE-EDGE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BODY SLAM<COL1,POP>
may be more effective.

<LINE,33>The type match-up and stats... Which kind of
weakness should be exploited? Learn to read
the situation thoroughly before committing
yourself to the next move.

<LINE,33>Today's topic is rather difficult, so listen
carefully. Pardon? They're always hard? Oh,
please don't be that way. Just think of it as
tough love.

<LINE,33>Today's topic is "Reading Your Rival." I'll
teach you to predict your opponent's next
move, then attack accordingly. 

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP>'s case

<LINE,33>A battle has gotten underway with the
GRASS-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP> facing off against the
WATER-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AZUMARILL<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Naturally, people would want to
use a GRASS-type move that is super-
effective against WATER-type POKéMON. For
instance, a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAZOR LEAF<COL1,POP> would be
dandy.

<LINE,33>But wait just a moment. Consider things from
your opponent's perspective. If it were you,
wouldn't you want to switch out? Not only
that, wouldn't you think about sending out a
FIRE-type POKéMON that is strong against
the GRASS-type?

<LINE,33>Against a FIRE-type POKéMON, a GRASS-type
move's power is halved. It's rather vexing.
What should you do about it?

<LINE,33>I would use a NORMAL-type move that is
equally effective against the WATER type and
FIRE type. In other words, a move that would
be just as effective whether the opponent
switches out or not. For example, I would use
a NORMAL-type move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BODY SLAM<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Against most POKéMON types, a NORMAL-type
move's damage multiplier is one. So if you want
to be sure to inflict damage, a NORMAL-type
move works quite well.

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP>'s case

<LINE,33>Let's look at another battle. Suppose you
have sent out the WATER-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP>.
Your opponent has led with the FIRE-type
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RAPIDASH<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Again, let's try to guess what your opponent
is thinking. It's likely that your opponent will
switch out and put in an ELECTRIC-type
POKéMON that is tough against your
WATER-type POKéMON.

<LINE,33>I would suggest using a GROUND-type move
that is super-effective against both FIRE-
type and ELECTRIC-type POKéMON. By doing
so, it wouldn't matter if my opponent
switched or not. For example, I would use a
move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>Do you see? A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP> with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>.
Outsmarting your foes begins with the moves
you choose to teach to your POKéMON.

<LINE,33>This is how trainers will try to anticipate
each other's actions in high-level battles.
Determine what POKéMON your opponent has
chosen, then use moves in anticipation of
what he or she may do in battle.

<LINE,33>Ah, I seem to have run out of topics. You
must stop relying on me for all the answers.
To become a full-fledged POKéMON trainer in
your own right, you must think and decide for
yourself. Now...

<LINE,33>It is up to you to do your best from now on!

<LINE,33>That boosts the power of the ROCK-type
move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP> by ten percent.

<LINE,33>&

<LINE,33>A GHOST-type move is a physical attack. Its
power depends on its ATTACK stats.

<LINE,33>Not only that, its SPCL.ATK stat is high.
PSYCHIC-type moves should make your
POKéMON a tough customer indeed.

<COL1,PUSH,230,220,100,255>TRAINER CLASS<COL1,LOAD,255,255,255,255> LECTURES

<COL1,PUSH,70,160,255,255>ELITE FOUR CLASS<COL1,LOAD,255,255,255,255> LECTURES

<LINE,33>Here it comes... Here it
comes... And there it
goes! Ka-boom! The
damage is multiplied
#7124 times<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>!

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FUTURE SIGHT<COL1,POP>

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BONE RUSH<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>I suggest deliberately delaying evolution
till your POKéMON learn some good moves.

<LINE,33>If you switch out a POKéMON, then switch
it in again, it will be cured of any status
problem. Don't forget that.

<LINE,33>At Level 31, it learns <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PETAL DANCE<COL1,POP>. If
you want it to learn this move, it can't
learn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>These moves inflict damage, but they also
return half the HP of that damage to
the user. So in a way, they can be
considered healing moves.

<LINE,33>Rather than the special attack <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>,
the physical attack <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEADBUTT<COL1,POP> should be
able to inflict more damage.

<LINE,33>The attack's power is doubled! This kind
of move combination is known as a combo,
and it can be very useful in battle.

<LINE,33>You can also create combos using moves
like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLPOOL<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>For example, you'll be able to see a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>HOPPIP<COL1,POP> that knows <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAY DAY<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP> doubles the physical attack
power of <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>If <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERBOLT<COL1,POP> hits the weak spot of
the WATER- & FLYING-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GYARADOS<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>There is a DAY CARE business on ROUTE 34. If
you leave a male and a female POKéMON there,
you might find an EGG when you return. Under
what conditions will an EGG be made? Let me
tell you.

<LINE,33>An EGG may be found if the male and female
POKéMON are somewhat similar in appearance.
For example, the pair could be a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> and
a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SANDSLASH<COL1,POP>, or an <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP> and a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGMAR<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>POKéMON that do not look anything like each
other, such as a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BUTTERFREE<COL1,POP> and a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GIRAFARIG<COL1,POP>, will show no interest in each
other. A pair like that will not make an EGG.

<LINE,33>A POKéMON pair that has a possibility of
making an EGG is called an #71EGG group<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If a
POKéMON pair is not of the same #71EGG group<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>,
they will not make an EGG. You can study EGG
groups at the LIBRARY.

<LINE,33>By the way, a POKéMON that hatched from an
EGG may have more moves by the time it
reaches Level 5 than a regular POKéMON
would. It may even have the same moves as its
parents. What kinds of extra moves may be
learned?

<LINE,33>Number one, #71TM moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If the
POKéMON in the EGG can learn a TM
move and its male parent knows that
same move, the baby will be born with
that move.

<LINE,33>Number two, #71moves learned by
leveling up<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If the POKéMON in the
EGG can learn a certain move by
leveling up and both parents know the
same move, the baby will be born with
that move already learned.

<LINE,33>If four or more moves can be inherited, moves
the POKéMON would normally learn before
Level 5 will be forgotten, starting with the
one learned at the oldest.

<LINE,33>Incidentally, a POKéMON that comes from an
EGG will be hatched as a completely unevolved
form of the female parent.

<LINE,33>If, for example, the female POKéMON is a
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RATICATE<COL1,POP>, the EGG baby will be a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RATTATA<COL1,POP>. All
baby POKéMON will hatch at level 5. That will
give you plenty of opportunities to raise
them the way you want. Some POKéMON only
hatch from EGGs. Wouldn't you like to see
them?

<LINE,33>As you know, if you leave a male and female
POKéMON of the same EGG group at a
DAY CARE, you might come back to find an EGG.
Let me tell you a few additional things I know
about EGGs.

<LINE,33>If you're wondering why your POKéMON have
not made an EGG, go out into the DAY CARE's
yard to see how well they are getting along.

<LINE,33>There is a possibility that you will find an
EGG if your POKéMON:
-Appears to care for (POKéMON)
-Is friendly with (POKéMON)
-It shows interest in (POKéMON)

<LINE,33>An EGG will never be found if your POKéMON:
-It has no interest in (POKéMON)
-It's brimming with energy

<LINE,33>My own experience tells me that a male and a
female of the same kind of POKéMON tend to
become friendly toward each other.

<LINE,33>The paired POKéMON also tend to become
friendly toward each other if they were
caught by different trainers. Using these
tips should help you find EGGS.

<LINE,33>Now let me tell you about a big secret.

<LINE,33>A POKéMON hatched from an EGG may know
moves that it normally wouldn't learn by
leveling up or by using a TM!

<LINE,33>It appears that baby POKéMON inherit moves
from their male parents. My, EGGS are so
strange! These oddly inherited moves are
known as #71EGG moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.

<LINE,33>An #71EGG move<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is a move that a baby POKéMON
has inherited from its male parent when it
hatches. The #71EGG moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> that a baby
POKéMON can learn depends on what kind of
POKéMON it is. If the male parent knows the
same kind of move, the baby POKéMON will
already know the move when it hatches.

<LINE,33>If you teach EGG moves properly, you could
breed a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>HORSEA<COL1,POP> that knows <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OCTAZOOKA<COL1,POP>...

<LINE,33>Does that surprise you? Why don't you go to
the LIBRARY and check the EGG moves that
various kinds of POKéMON can learn.

<LINE,33>Like everything else, you should start off on
the right foot in a POKéMON battle. If three
POKéMON are to go into battle, you should
be excited from the moment you send out your
lead-off POKéMON. Wouldn't you agree?

<LINE,33>Fine. Then what kind of POKéMON would be
ideal as your leading battler?

<LINE,33>Now, some of you may think that you should
just send out your favorite POKéMON
whenever you like. And you certainly can do
that. But hold on just one second. Wouldn't
you feel sad if your POKéMON were defeated
right away because its weaknesses were
exploited?

<LINE,33>That's why I personally use a POKéMON
with few weak aspects as my lead-off
battler.

<LINE,33>For example, I recommend a NORMAL-type or
an ELECTRIC-type POKéMON because they
have few type match-up weaknesses.

<LINE,33>If a POKéMON has few type mismatches,
it means that there is less chance that its
weak points will be exploited. In turn, that
also means you won't have to switch it out to
get away from a type mismatch.

<LINE,33>If you don't know what kind of POKéMON your
opponent will send out first, you should
consider my recommendation.

ELECTRIC-type POKéMON : <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FLAAFFY<COL1,POP>

Flaaf? Flaaf?

<LINE,33>Also, from my own experience, it is convenient
for your party to have at least one POKéMON
that would be unaffected by a certain type
of move, depending on the type match-up.

<LINE,33>For example, a GROUND-type POKéMON that is
unaffected by any ELECTRIC-type move or a
FLYING-type POKéMON that can't be hit by a
GROUND-type move. If a POKéMON can avoid
damage entirely due to a type match-up, the
battle is likely to be tipped in your favor.

<LINE,33>Welcome to the GYM LEADER CLASS! Since you
keep attending my classes, I guess you must
like what I have to offer. I certainly am glad!
Today I would like to talk about types. The
lesson is a little long, so please do try to
stay awake.
