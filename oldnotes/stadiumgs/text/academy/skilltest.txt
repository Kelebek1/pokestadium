<LINE,24>I just love GRASS-type POKéMON. Betcha don't know what
types of POKéMON are tough against the GRASS type!

<LINE,24>Wow, you really showed me the weak points of GRASS-type
POKéMON.

<LINE,24>Your win earlier was just a fluke. I'll use my GRASS-type
POKéMON again!

<LINE,24>Wow, you really know how to exploit the weaknesses of
GRASS-type POKéMON...

<LINE,24>A decisive victory without a single
KO'd POKéMON! How beautiful!

<LINE,24>You picked your POKéMON
perfectly! That was a beautiful
victory!

<LINE,24>Shucks! I lost this time, but just you wait!
I won't let it happen again!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. It seems
that not all of your POKéMON are
tough against the GRASS type. 

<LINE,24>Don't you know the weak points of GRASS-type POKéMON?
Maybe you should look up type match-ups at the LIBRARY.

<LINE,24>What's the matter?
You chose POKéMON that are
strong against the GRASS type,
right?

<LINE,24>I'm studying the weaknesses of FIRE-type POKéMON.
Would you help me, please?

<LINE,24>Thank you for showing me some moves that are tough
against FIRE POKéMON... (...fizzle...)

<LINE,24>Uh-oh. The test we performed earlier was a failure. Try
another move that's tough against FIRE-type POKéMON?

<LINE,24>I finally know the weak points of FIRE POKéMON... But now
I'm all burnt out from studying... (fizzle...)

<LINE,24>Magnificent! A perfect victory!
You are quite good. Beautiful!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were just
right. You came so close to a
perfect victory.

<LINE,24>It was sheer coincidence that you beat me. Logic proves
my point!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. I believe
you could choose better POKéMON
combinations.

<LINE,24>Hee, hee, hee! Don't you even know type match-ups? Well,
if you don't know, I'm not about to tell you!

<LINE,24>Oh? Do you know what types of
moves are super-effective against
FIRE-type POKéMON?

<LINE,24>There are many different types of POKéMON in my party.
There's no way you can pick on a weak point!

<LINE,24>You picked on our weak points perfectly! I'm surprised
you know so much about type match-ups.

<LINE,24>You have to be smart and go after my POKéMON's weak
spots. Otherwise, you're never gonna hurt my team!

<LINE,24>This isn't good... I never imagined there could be someone
who would know so much about type match-ups...

<LINE,24>Bravo! You did an excellent job of
exploiting your opponent's
weaknesses. That certainly was a
perfect victory.

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right
on the mark! You zeroed in on your
opponent's weak points perfectly!

<LINE,24>This... This must be a mistake! I'm not going to lose like
that next time!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps
you should think a little harder
when choosing your POKéMON.

<LINE,24>Ha, ha, ha! That was pretty sad! Go check type match-ups
at the LIBRARY.

<LINE,24>You should switch your POKéMON
during battle to gain type
match-up advantages over your
opponent.

<LINE,24>Listen here! <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> add up to the
perfect defense! Let's see you try to break through it!

<LINE,24>...You won! I should have remembered about set damage
moves.

<LINE,24>I fooled around last time. But now my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> plan is ready for Round 2!

<LINE,24>It doesn't matter how high you raise your defenses if
your opponent uses set damage moves... (...glub...)

<LINE,24>A perfect victory earned by seeing
through the opponent's strategy.
Magnificent! And beautiful!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were
impeccable. You were smart to use
set damage moves!

<LINE,24>I got careless and lost. The way you won just isn't fair!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too pretty. Perhaps
there are better ways to choose
POKéMON. Wouldn't you agree?

<LINE,24>You're not helping me train... I'll try these moves on a
lady swimmer next time.

<LINE,24>Oh? Don't you know about moves
that inflict damage regardless of
defensive stats?

<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>... If they hit, they'll KO
anything! Think you can dodge 'em?

<LINE,24>The way you dodged my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>...
You're incredible!

<LINE,24>Oh, it's you again! My <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP> aren't
beaten yet!

<LINE,24>Oh, right... You could dodge an attack by using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,24>You saw through your opponent's
plan and came through for a
flawless win. Beautiful!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right
on! You were able to read your
opponent's plan exactly! Beautiful!

<LINE,24>Rats! But my strategy wasn't a total failure!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Think
about the way you chose your
party... Perhaps you left an open-
ing for your opponent to exploit?

<LINE,24>Yeah! That worked perfectly! What do you think? Wasn't it
a great move?

<LINE,24>There are moves that, if timed
properly, will avoid an attack, then
strike the opponent.

<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> is an amazing move. How do you plan to
counter it?

<LINE,24>You beat my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>? I'll have to train even harder.

<LINE,24>This doesn't mean that <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> was defeated. Face me
again!

<LINE,24>I went to all the effort of using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>... And you just
used physical attacks? It's not fair!

<LINE,24>A perfect win without a single
POKéMON going down! Your skills
are fabulous!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices couldn't
have been better. Those physical
attacks scored knockouts!

<LINE,24>Not bad... But wait 'til next time. I think you still have
weak spots.

<LINE,24>Hmm...  Not too beautiful. Your
POKéMON choices left something to
be desired.

<LINE,24>Oh, yeah! See? Didn't I tell you <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> was great?

<LINE,24>Hmm... Do you understand the
difference between physical and
special attacks?

<LINE,24>Hey, hey! I'm gonna <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> ya! You won't even touch
my POKéMON!

<LINE,24>So there's more than one way to make a move hit...? I've
gotta work harder at this!

<LINE,24>It was a coincidence that you hit my POKéMON earlier!
I'm gonna go with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> again, I say. Again!

<LINE,24>There is a way to hit my POKéMON even after I use
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>? That makes me double angry!

<LINE,24>You weren't fazed at all by your
opponent's strategy. Your perfect
win was beautiful!

<LINE,24>Your choice of POKéMON was
perfect, too. You broke up the
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> in a most exemplary
manner!

<LINE,24>Hmph! I may have lost this time, but if we battle again,
watch out! That's right. Watch out!

<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Perhaps you
should consider using only POKéMON
that can handle opponents that
have heightened evasiveness.

<LINE,24>How do you like the power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>? Your moves
missed over and over!

<LINE,24>There is a move that always hits.
Perhaps you've heard of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWIFT<COL1,POP>?

If you can't tell the difference between a real status
problem and one that's only similar, you'll never beat me!

<LINE,24>I've had enough of status problems like those. You really
are something special.

<LINE,24>No, no. My POKéMON can take a lot more than that.

<LINE,24>You certainly gave me a harsh lesson on POKéMON
conditions. (...sniff...)

<LINE,24>You have very good grasp on the
distinction between status
problems and similar conditions.

<LINE,24>You have a beautiful knowledge of
conditions that are similar to
status problems.

<LINE,24>You'll have to be a lot more thorough if you really want to
beat me.

<LINE,24>Hmm... The way you choose POKéMON
tells me that you are still showing
some mercy toward your opponent.
That's not beautiful!

<LINE,24>I don't think you know the distinction between real
status problems and conditions that only appear similar.

<LINE,24>Performance-affecting conditions
that aren't real status problems
can be doubled up on a POKéMON.
Did you know that?

<LINE,24>I shall lead with <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP>, then follow with GHOST
POKéMON. How will you vanquish such a diabolical team?

<LINE,24>Combining items and moves... I see. I shall have EARL
instruct me.

<LINE,24>I shall use the same lineup--<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP> followed by
GHOST-type POKéMON.

<LINE,24>Using combinations of items and moves... My, that's
wicked.

<LINE,24>An excellent demonstration of how
to use items! You showed me a
splendid shutout win!

<LINE,24>You attained a grand victory using
only certain POKéMON and items.
Beautiful!  

<LINE,24>That wasn't my best performance. May I battle you again?@

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. When
choosing your battlers, take note
of the items they are holding.

<LINE,24>You couldn't win even after I told you my lineup...? That
is amazing in its own way...

<LINE,24>When choosing your POKéMON, pay
attention to the items they are
holding.

<LINE,24>I have dual-type POKéMON. Think you can pick on the
weaknesses?

<LINE,24>I'm going to study every day so I won't lose to you!

<LINE,24>Last time was some kind of mistake! Let's see you hit the
weak spots!

<LINE,24>Oh... When there are two types, you end up with more weak
points...

<LINE,24>A perfect victory by maximally
exploiting type match-up
advantages! This is too beautiful!

<LINE,24>You earned that win by maximally
exploiting type match-up
advantages. Beautiful!

<LINE,24>What do you mean by that? If we battled again, I'd win
for sure! Grrr...

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps
you should choose POKéMON that
can exploit the weaknesses of both
of a dual-type POKéMON's types.

<LINE,24>(...giggle...) Unless you pick at my weak spots, there's no
chance of me losing.

<LINE,24>If you hit both of the weak
aspects of a dual-type POKéMON,
you'll inflict quadruple the damage.

<LINE,24>I use only <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>! I won't use anything else. Can you
overcome them?

<LINE,24>Wow, there are moves that work on a POKéMON that's
using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>! ...Whew! DUSTIN got a good lesson here!

<LINE,24>I stand by my decision to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Come on, let's
battle again!

<LINE,24>Moves that hit while I'm using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>... I never
knew! No one ever told me about them!

<LINE,24>You used your opponent's moves
and strategy against them to get
that perfect win! Beautiful!

<LINE,24>You used your opponent's moves
and strategy to earn the win!
Beautiful!

<LINE,24>Argh! No! But if we battle again, I'm confident that I'll
win.

<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Consider
choosing POKéMON with moves that
can strike an opponent that's
using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,24>How do you like the power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>? As long as I
have them, I can't lose!

<LINE,24>You should investigate moves that
can strike POKéMON that are using
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,24>Not only do my POKéMON have high SPCL.DEF stats, but
they also know <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,24>Ack... My party was much too weak against physical
attacks... It's a total wipeout.

<LINE,24>My POKéMON have high SPCL.DEF stats, and they know how
to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>. Come on. Battle me again!

<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>-type POKéMON using physical attacks? I
haven't learned formulas like that yet...

<LINE,24>Using physical attacks when your
opponent didn't expect them! That
was a beautiful, perfect win!

<LINE,24>Sometimes it can be more effective
for <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>-type POKéMON to use
physical attacks. Expertly done!

<LINE,24>This isn't what I was taught! If we battle again, I'll win!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Your choices of POKéMON are
still somewhat lax. Not too
beautiful.

<LINE,24>Ha, ha, ha! Didn't I tell you? My POKéMON's SPCL.DEF
stats are perfect!

<LINE,24>If the opponent has high SPCL.DEF
stats, using physical attacks is
one possible approach.

<LINE,24>I rely solely on <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>! Only the toughest POKéMON
will be able to withstand it.

<LINE,24>...That was a wash-out. I'll have to watch for a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>
holding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> holding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP>.

With my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, I'm ready for more! Only the
toughest POKéMON will be able to withstand it.

A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> holding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> holding a
<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP>... Well thought. I lost completely.

<LINE,24>You earned a magnificently perfect
win by using every factor to your
advantage. It's too amazing!

<LINE,24>You used a variety of factors to
your advantage. You clearly
understand how items work!

<LINE,24>Darn it! I lost by sheer coincidence, but it won't be this
way next time. I challenge you to another battle!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. You need
to be a little more clever when
choosing your POKéMON.

<LINE,24>After using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, POKéMON get tired and have to
rest. That leaves them vulnerable.

<LINE,24>If a tough POKéMON is hit with
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, you can switch out
while the opponent is recharging.

<LINE,24>First I raise my ATTACK stat, then I use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>.
Can your POKéMON safely weather such a blast?

<LINE,24>I was going to beat <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP> using speedy POKéMON... I
hate to admit it, but you win.

<LINE,24>I'm going to raise my ATTACK stat, then let loose a
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. Can you stay safe this time?

<LINE,24>An <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP> combo...? Could you teach me
how to do that?

<LINE,24>You know exactly how moves work.
That was a beautiful shutout!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right
on the money. You earned that
beautiful win by boosting your
SPEED.

<LINE,24>I lost... but I'm going to win next time! You should be more
careful when choosing your POKéMON.

<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Be very careful
when choosing POKéMON. Try to
create a team in which every
member has a chance of winning.

<LINE,24>So slow! Your POKéMON are way too slow. They make
fantastic targets!

<LINE,24>Watch for the instant when your
opponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. That's
when you should use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,24>Show me some beautiful combos. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DRAGONITE<COL1,POP>! <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYRANITAR<COL1,POP>!
Assist us in this demonstration!

<LINE,24>Whew... There's no beating that. I'm awed by your superb
combo performance!

<LINE,24>Let me see your combos again. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DRAGONITE<COL1,POP>! <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYRANITAR<COL1,POP>!
Go!

<LINE,24>I never knew such an inspired combo existed... I've got to
keep polishing my act.

<LINE,24>You obviously know your combos.
Your perfect victory was almost
as beautiful as I am!

<LINE,24>You made excellent use of combos.
You are quite a beautiful student!

<LINE,24>Wha... I... I lost? Tch... I won't take you for granted
next time! Prepare to lose!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps
you ought to choose only those
POKéMON that possess effective
combos?

<LINE,24>If you want to measure up to my act, come at me with
some beautiful combos!

<LINE,24>Try to hit each of your opponent's
POKéMON with combos that are
effective against them
specifically.

<LINE,24>I'm feeling sort of blue. I'll show you my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> and
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> combo.

<LINE,24>Controlling the weather is a clever way to give yourself
the advantage in battle.

<LINE,24>I'm going to be serious this time... I'll demonstrate the
power of the <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> combo!

<LINE,24>A team that becomes stronger with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> is very
weak against <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>... You're so mean!

<LINE,24>It's clear you understand combos
that rely on the weather. A
beautifully executed perfect
victory!

<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were
precisely correct. You clearly
understand the relationship bet-
ween weather and certain moves.

<LINE,24>I've been attending this academy for a long time. I won't
lose! Battle me once more!

<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. I have a
feeling that the way you chose
your POKéMON was a bit careless.

<LINE,24>Haven't you been paying any attention to EARL's lessons?
What a waste.

<LINE,24>Use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP> against the
opponent's <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>. Use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STOMP<COL1,POP>
for <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP>.
