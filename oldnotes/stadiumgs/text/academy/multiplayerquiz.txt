I can only keep getting better! Losing is
not an option!

Experience the true ferocity of the
ELITE FOUR.

Hm? I see no fear in you. You look
determined.

Hoo hah!

Having lost, I have no right to say
anything... Go face your next challenge!

Just try to entertain me.

Strong POKéMON. Weak POKéMON. Those are
only the selfish perceptions of people.

I live in shadows--a ninja!

POKéMON is not merely about brute force...
You shall see soon enough!

I must hone my skills.

As a trainer, I will use my full power
against any other trainer!

I lost? I don't believe it. There must be
some mistake...

From now on, I'm going to train
24 hours a day!

...Thank you for your help at the
LIGHTHOUSE...

...You are a better trainer than me, in
both skill and kindness.

Um... I don't know how to say this,
but good luck...

I have been with POKéMON
since before you were born.

With your strong will, I know you will
overcome all of life's obstacles.

I believed that tale, so I have secretly
trained here all my life.

As a result, I can now see
what others cannot.

I could see a future in which I meet the
legendary POKéMON.

Everyone was into POKéMON, so I got
into it, too! POKéMON are super-cute!

You want to battle? I'm warning
you--I'm good!

Ah, that was a good cry! Come back
and visit again! Bye-bye!

I'll show you the real power of the
magnificent bird POKéMON!

My Dad's cherished bird POKéMON...

I'm going to train harder to become the
greatest bird master ever!

But if nature so much as twitches,
we can lose in a second.

I'm still a trainer. If I see a strong
opponent, it makes me want to battle.

If you want to battle me, come to the
VIRIDIAN GYM.

I wasn't in the mood at CINNABAR, but now
I'm ready to battle you.

You're telling me you conquered all the
GYMs in JOHTO? Heh! JOHTO's GYMs
must be pretty pathetic then.

Hey, don't worry about it. I'll see if you
are good or not by battling you right now.

You're the real deal.
You are a good trainer.

But I'm going to beat you someday. Don't
you forget it!

My GYM in CINNABAR burned down.

When I rebuild my CINNABAR GYM,
we'll have to have a rematch.

Three years ago I had a vision of
your arrival.

Since you wish it, I will show you my
psychic powers!

I don't enjoy battling, but it's my duty as
a LEADER to confer BADGES on anyone
who has proven him- or herself worthy.

Your power... It far exceeds what I
foresaw... Maybe it isn't possible to fully
predict what the future holds...

You will become a celebrated and beloved
CHAMPION!

The power of love, I think, is also
a kind of psychic power...

Hee, hee... I'm sorry to disappoint you...
I'm only joking! I'm the real one.

I'm going to really apply myself and
improve my skills.

Hello... Lovely weather,
isn't it?

Very well,but I shall not lose.

Hey, little boy!
I have to hand it to you.

When it comes to electric POKéMON,
I'm number one!

Hey, boy! Still slugging and chugging away?
My POKéMON and I are still at it!

Come to CERULEAN GYM.
I'll be happy to take you on.
