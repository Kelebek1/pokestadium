<FACE,55,2>You'll freeze if you're not careful.

<FACE,55,2>I'm going with #26!

<FACE,55,2>My choice is #26!

<FACE,55,2>#26 ought to do it.

<FACE,55,2>Play it cool, #26.

<FACE,55,2>#26 might be the one.

<FACE,55,2>#26 might not be right.

<FACE,55,2>#26 gets the hook.

<FACE,55,2>I'm switching #26 out.

<FACE,55,2>I'm pulling #26.

<FACE,55,0>Oh, no! My #26!

<FACE,55,1>Ooh, fabulous!

<FACE,55,1>Look, look! Isn't it super? Now that's a
critical hit!

<FACE,55,0>Critical hit? That one doesn't count! No?
