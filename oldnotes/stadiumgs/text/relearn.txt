Which move should be forgotten
instead of #65?

#66 will be forgotten and
#65 will be learned. OK?

Don't let your POKéMON learn the TM?

#25 can learn these TMs.

#25 wants to
forget #65.

1, 2 and...

1, 2 and...Poof!

#25 forgot how to
use #65!

And...

#25 learned 
#66!

Thank you very much for
coming.

Is it OK to learn #65?

There are no moves to relearn.

This is an important Move. You can't
make your POKéMON forget it.

Your POKéMON can't learn Moves while
challenging the Battle Tower in the 
Crystal version.

Rental POKéMON can't learn TMs.
