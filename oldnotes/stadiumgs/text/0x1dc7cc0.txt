What? #26 is evolving!

Huh? #26 stopped evolving!

Congratulations! Your #26
evolved into #34!

#32 was sent to #21.

#26 learned #65!

#26 is trying to learn
#65.

But #26 can't learn more than
four moves.

Delete an older move to make room for
#65?

#26 did not learn #65.

Stop learning #65?

If #65 is learned, this POKÃ©MON
cannot be moved to <TEX,1>.
Is that OK?

Which move should
be forgotten?

OK?

?????
