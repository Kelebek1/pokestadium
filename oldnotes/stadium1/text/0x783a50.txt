This is a sophisticated PC.
You can study Pokémon on it,
organize your items and so on.

This is a machine for trading Pokémon.
You can trade directly with a friend's
Game Boy Game Pak.

Use this machine to select a
currently inserted Game Boy
Game Pak.

This machine lets you check out your
POKéDEX in detail.
It also identifies where Pokémon live.

You won a Pokémon as a prize!
That's quite an accomplishment.
Here you go!

I was entrusted with a Pokémon
for you.

It's in this Poké Ball.
Take good care of it. Take the BALL
and tell me where you want to put it.

This seems to be a new Game Pak,
or its SAVE file is corrupted.@

The chosen Game Pak hasn't been
saved at a POKéMON CENTER.

You don't have a POKéDEX.
You'd better get one from a Game Boy
Game Pak.

You don't have a POKéDEX.
This machine won't work without one.

You need to have two Game Paks if you
want to trade.

It's too bad, but that BOX is full.
Change over to a different BOX using
the PC.
